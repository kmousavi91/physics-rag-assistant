postulates the existence of a quantum ﬁeld responsible for the generation of the masses of fundamental particles through a phenomenon known as the Brout–Englert–Higgs mechanism. This ﬁeld, known as the Higgs ﬁeld [1–3], interacts with SM particles, giving them mass, as well as with itself. The ﬁeld carrier is a massive, scalar (spin-0) particle known as the Higgs (H) boson. Nearly half a century after its postulation, it was ﬁnally observed in 2012 with a mass mHof around 125 GeV by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations [4– 6] at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC).

open. Nearly ﬁfty years ago it was proposed [1–6] that spontaneous symmetry breaking in gauge theories could be achieved through the introduction of a scalar ﬁeld. Applying this mechanism to the electroweak theory [7–9] through a complex scalar doublet ﬁeld leads to the generation of the W and Z masses, and to the prediction of the existence of the SM Higgs boson (H). The scalar ﬁeld also gives mass to the fundamental fermions through the Yukawa interaction. The mass mHof the SM Higgs boson is not predicted by theory. However, general considera- tions [10–13] suggest that mHshould be smaller than 1 TeV, while precision electroweak mea- surements imply that mH<152 GeV at 95% conﬁdence level

has excellent mass res- olution due to precise photon energy scale and resolution calibrations. However, they were still the dominant systematic uncertainties for the mass measurement in the previous analysis [14]. ATLAS improves the calibration method of the photon energy scale and resolution, in particu- lar, in-situ calibration using 𝑍→𝑒𝑒events providing a significant reduction of the systematic uncertainties [15]. The systematic uncertainty of photon calibration is reduced by a factor of four. The measured Higgs boson mass is 125.17 ±0.11(stat.)±0.09(syst.) GeV in Run 2 dataset and 125.22±0.11(stat.)±0.09(syst.) GeV combined with Run 1 dataset [14]. ATLAS combined mass measurement of 𝐻→𝛾
