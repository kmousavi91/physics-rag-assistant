Introduction The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics [1–4] has been tested by many experimentsover the last four decades and has been shown to successfully describe high energy particle interactions. However, the mecha- nism that breaks electroweak symmetry in the SM has not been veriﬁed experimentally. This mechanism [5– 10], which gives mass to massive elementary particles, impliesthe existence of a scalar particle, the SM Higgs boson. The search for the Higgs boson, the only ele- mentary particle in the SM that has not yet been ob- served,isoneofthehighlightsoftheLargeHadronCol- lider[11] (LHC)physicsprogramme. Indirectlimitsonthe SM Higgsbosonmassof mH< 158GeV at 95% conﬁdence level (CL) have been set using global ﬁts to precision electroweak results [12]. Direct searches at LEP [13], the Tevatron [14–16] and theLHC[17,18]havepreviouslyexcluded,at95%CL, aSMHiggsbosonwithmassbelow600GeV,apartfrom somemassregionsbetween116GeV and127GeV. Both the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations reported excesses of events in their 2011 datasets of proton- proton ( pp) collisions at centre-of-mass energy√s= 7TeV at the LHC, which were compatible with SM Higgs boson production and decay in the mass region 124–126GeV,withsigniﬁcancesof2.9and3.1standarddeviations( σ), respectively[17, 18]. TheCDF andDØ experimentsat the Tevatronhave also recentlyreported a broad excess in the mass region 120–135GeV; using theexistingLHCconstraints,theobservedlocalsigniﬁ- cancesfor mH=125GeVare2.7 σforCDF [14],1.1 σ forDØ[15]and2.8 σfortheircombination[16]. ThepreviousATLASsearchesin4.6–4.8fb−1ofdata at√s=7TeVarecombinedherewithnewsearchesfor H→ZZ(∗)→4ℓ1,H→γγandH→WW(∗)→eνµνin the 5.8–5.9fb−1ofppcollision data taken at√s=8TeV betweenAprilandJune2012. Thedatawererecordedwithinstantaneousluminosi- ties up to 6 .8×1033cm−2s−1; they are therefore af- fected by multiple ppcollisions occurring in the same orneighbouringbunchcrossings(pile-up). Inthe7TeV data, the average number of interactions per bunch crossing was approximately 10; the average increased to approximately20 in the 8TeV data. The reconstruc- tion, identiﬁcation and isolation criteria used for elec-
tronsandphotonsinthe8TeVdataareimproved,mak- ing the H→ZZ(∗)→4ℓandH→γγsearches more ro- bust against the increased pile-up. These analyseswere re-optimisedwith simulationandfrozenbeforelooking at the8TeV data. 1Thesymbol ℓstands for electron or muon.

Since the eµchannel provides most of the sensitivity of the search, only this ﬁnal state is used in the anal- ysis of the 8TeV data. The kinematic region in which a SM Higgs boson with a mass between 110 GeV and 140 GeV is searched for was kept blinded during the analysis optimisation, until satisfactory agreement was found between the observed and predicted numbers of events in control samples dominated by the principal backgrounds. This Letter is organised as follows. The ATLAS de- tector is brieﬂy described in Section 2. The simula- tionsamples andthe signal predictionsare presentedin Section 3. The analyses of the H→ZZ(∗)→4ℓ,H→γγ andH→WW(∗)→eνµνchannels are described in Sec- tions 4–6, respectively. The statistical procedure used to analyse the results is summarised in Section 7. The systematic uncertainties which are correlated between datasetsandsearchchannelsaredescribedinSection8. The results of the combination of all channels are re- portedinSection 9,whileSection10providesthecon- clusions. 2. The ATLAS detector TheATLASdetector[19–21]isamultipurposeparti- cle physics apparatus with forward-backward symmet- ric cylindrical geometry. The inner tracking detector (ID) consists of a silicon pixel detector, a silicon mi- crostrip detector (SCT), and a straw-tube transition ra- diationtracker(TRT).TheIDissurroundedbyathinsu- perconductingsolenoid which providesa 2 T magnetic ﬁeld, and by high-granularity liquid-argon (LAr) sam- plingelectromagneticcalorimetry. Theelectromagnetic calorimeter is divided into a central barrel (pseudora- pidity2|η|<1.475) and end-cap regions on either end of the detector (1 .375<|η|<2.5 for the outer wheel and 2.5<|η|<3.2 for the inner wheel). In the region matched to the ID ( |η|<2.5), it is radially segmented intothreelayers. Theﬁrstlayerhasa ﬁnesegmentation 2ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate
system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the centre of the detec tor, and thez-axis along the beam line. The x-axis points from the IP to the centreoftheLHCring,andthe y-axispointsupwards. Cylindrical co- ordinates ( r,φ)areused in thetransverse plane, φbeing theazimuthal angle around the beam line. Observables labelled “transver se” are projected into the x−yplane. The pseudorapidity is deﬁned in terms of thepolar angle θasη=−lntan(θ/2).inηto facilitate e/γseparation from π0and to improve theresolutionoftheshowerpositionanddirectionmea- surements. In the region |η|<1.8, the electromagnetic calorimeterisprecededbyapresamplerdetectortocor- rectforupstreamenergylosses. Aniron-scintillator /tile calorimeter gives hadronic coverage in the central ra- pidity range (|η|<1.7), while a LAr hadronic end-cap calorimeterprovidescoverageover1 .5<|η|<3.2. The forwardregions(3 .2<|η|<4.9)are instrumentedwith LArcalorimetersforbothelectromagneticandhadronic measurements. Themuonspectrometer(MS)surrounds the calorimeters and consists of three large air-core su- perconducting magnets providing a toroidal ﬁeld, each with eight coils, a system of precision tracking cham- bers, and fast detectors for triggering. The combi- nation of all these systems provides charged particle measurementstogetherwithe ﬃcientandpreciselepton and photon measurements in the pseudorapidity range |η|<2.5.

Signal and background simulation samples The SM Higgs boson production processes con- sidered in this analysis are the dominant gluon fu- sion ( gg→H, denoted ggF), vector-boson fusion (qq′→qq′H, denoted VBF) and Higgs-strahlung (qq′→WH,ZH, denoted WH/ZH). The small con- tribution from the associated production with a ttpair (q¯q/gg→t¯tH, denoted t¯tH) is taken into account only inthe H→γγanalysis. For the ggF process, the signal cross section is com- puted at up to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in QCD [22–28]. Next-to-leading order (NLO) elec- troweak (EW) corrections are applied [29, 30], as well asQCDsoft-gluonre-summationsatuptonext-to-next- to-leading logarithm (NNLL) [31]. These calculations, which are described in Refs. [32–35], assume factori- sation between QCD and EW corrections. The trans- verse momentum, pT, spectrum of the Higgs boson in theggFprocessfollowsthe HqTcalculation[36],which includesQCD correctionsat NLO and QCD
soft-gluon re-summations up to NNLL; the e ﬀects of ﬁnite quark massesarealso takenintoaccount[37]. For the VBF process, full QCD and EW correc- tionsuptoNLO[38–41]andapproximateNNLOQCD corrections [42] are used to calculate the cross sec- tion. Crosssectionsoftheassociated WH/ZHprocesses (VH) are calculated including QCD corrections up to NNLO [43–45] and EW corrections up to NLO [46]. 2 The cross sections for the t¯tHprocess are estimated up toNLOQCD [47–51]. Thetotal crosssectionsfor SM Higgsbosonproduc- tion at the LHC with mH=125GeV are predicted to be 17.5 pb for√s=7TeV and 22.3pb for√s= 8TeV[52, 53]. The branching ratios of the SM Higgs boson as a functionof mH, aswell astheiruncertainties,arecalcu- lated using the HDECAY [54] and PROPHECY4F [55, 56] programs and are taken from Refs. [52, 53].

Table 1: Event generators used to model the signal and backgr ound processes. “PYTHIA” indicates that PYTHIA6 and PYTHIA8 are used for simulations of√s=7TeV and√s=8TeV data, respec- tively.

The normalisations of the generated samples are obtained from the state of the art calculations described above. Several di ﬀerent programs are used to generate the hard-scattering pro- cesses. To generate parton showers and their hadroni- sation, and to simulate the underlying event [66–68], PYTHIA6 [69] (for 7TeV samples and 8TeV sam- ples produced with MadGraph [70, 71] or AcerMC) or PYTHIA8 [72] (for other 8TeV samples) are used. Al- ternatively, HERWIG [73] or SHERPA [74] are used to generate and hadronise parton showers, with the HERWIG underlyingeventsimulationperformedusing JIMMY [75]. When PYTHIA6 or HERWIG are used, TAUOLA [76]
and PHOTOS [77] are employed to de- scribetauleptondecaysandadditionalphotonradiation fromchargedleptons,respectively.Thefollowingpartondistributionfunction(PDF)sets are used: CT10 [78] for the POWHEG, MC@NLO, gg2WW and gg2ZZ samples; CTEQ6L1 [79] for the PYTHIA8, ALPGEN, AcerMC, MadGraph, HERWIG and SHERPA samples; and MRSTMCal [80] for the PYTHIA6samples. Acceptances and e ﬃciencies are obtained mostly from full simulations of the ATLAS detector [81] us- ing Geant4 [82]. These simulations include a realistic modellingofthepile-upconditionsobservedinthedata. Correctionsobtainedfrommeasurementsindataareap- plied to account for small di ﬀerencesbetween data and simulation (e.g. large samples of W,ZandJ/ψdecays areusedtoderivescalefactorsforleptonreconstruction andidentiﬁcatione ﬃciencies). 4.H→ZZ(∗)→4ℓchannel The search for the SM Higgs boson through the decay H→ZZ(∗)→4ℓ, whereℓ=eorµ, pro- vides good sensitivity over a wide mass range (110- 600 GeV),largelyduetotheexcellentmomentumreso- lution of the ATLAS detector. This analysis searches for Higgs boson candidates by selecting two pairs of isolatedleptons,eachofwhichiscomprisedoftwolep- tons with the same ﬂavour and opposite charge. The expectedcrosssectiontimesbranchingratioforthepro- cess H→ZZ(∗)→4ℓwith mH=125 GeV is 2.2fbfor√s=7 TeVand2.8fbfor√s=8 TeV. The largest background comes from continuum (Z(∗)/γ∗)(Z(∗)/γ∗) production, referred to hereafter as ZZ(∗). For low masses there are also important back- ground contributions from Z+jets and t¯tproduction, where charged lepton candidates arise either from de- caysofhadronswith b-orc-quarkcontentorfrommis- identiﬁcationofjets. The7 TeVdatahavebeenre-analysedandcombined withthe8 TeVdata. Theanalysisisimprovedinseveral aspectswithrespecttoRef.[83]toenhancethesensitiv- ity to a low-mass Higgs boson. In particular, the kine- matic selections are revised, and the 8 TeV data anal- ysis beneﬁts from improvements in the electron recon- struction and identiﬁcation. The expected signal sig- niﬁcances for a Higgs boson with mH=125 GeV are 1.6σfor the 7 TeV data (to be compared with 1.25 σ inRef. [83])and2.1 σforthe8 TeVdata. 4.1. Event selection The data are selected using single-lepton or dilepton triggers. For the single-muon trigger, the pTthreshold is18 GeVforthe7 TeVdataand24 GeVforthe8 TeV 3 data,while forthe single-electrontriggerthetransverse energy, ET,thresholdvariesfrom20 GeVto22 GeVfor the 7 TeV data and is 24 GeV for the 8 TeV data. For the dielectron triggers, the thresholds are 12 GeV
for both electrons. For the dimuon triggers, the thresholds for the 7 TeV data are 10 GeV for each muon, while forthe 8 TeVdata thethresholdsare 13 GeV. Anaddi- tional asymmetric dimuon trigger is used in the 8 TeV datawiththresholds18 GeVand8 GeVfortheleading andsub-leadingmuon,respectively. Muon candidates are formed by matching recon- structed ID tracks with either a complete track or a track-segmentreconstructedin the MS [84]. The muon acceptance is extended with respect to Ref. [83] us- ing tracks reconstructed in the forward region of the MS (2.5<|η|<2.7), which is outside the ID cov- erage. If both an ID and a complete MS track are present,thetwoindependentmomentummeasurements are combined; otherwise the information of the ID or the MS is used alone. Electron candidates must have a well-reconstructed ID track pointing to an electromag- netic calorimeter cluster and the cluster should satisfy a set of identiﬁcation criteria [85] that require the lon- gitudinal and transverse shower proﬁles to be consis- tent with those expected for electromagnetic showers. Tracks associated with electromagnetic clusters are ﬁt- ted using a Gaussian-Sum Filter [86], which allows for bremsstrahlungenergylosses tobetakenintoaccount. Each electron (muon) must satisfy pT>7 GeV (pT>6 GeV) and be measured in the pseudorapidity range|η|<2.47 (|η|<2.7). All possible quadruplet combinationswithsame-ﬂavouropposite-chargelepton pairsare then formed. The most energeticlepton in the quadruplet must satisfy pT>20 GeV, and the second (third) lepton in pTorder must satisfy pT>15 GeV (pT>10 GeV). At least one of the leptons must satisfy the single-lepton trigger or one pair must sat- isfy the dilepton trigger requirements. The leptons are required to be separated from each other by ∆R=/radicalbig (∆η)2+(∆φ)2>0.1 if they are of the same ﬂavour andby∆R>0.2otherwise. Thelongitudinalimpactpa- rametersoftheleptonsalongthebeamaxisarerequired tobewithin10mmofthereconstructedprimaryvertex. The primary vertex used for the event is deﬁned as the reconstructedvertexwiththehighest/summationtextp2 Tofassociated tracks and is required to have at least three tracks with pT>0.4GeV. To reject cosmic
rays, muon tracks are requiredto have a transverse impact parameter,deﬁned asthedistanceofclosestapproachtotheprimaryvertex inthetransverseplane,ofless than1mm. The same-ﬂavour and opposite-charge lepton pairwithaninvariantmassclosesttothe Zbosonmass( mZ) inthequadrupletisreferredtoastheleadingleptonpair. Its invariant mass, denoted by m12, is required to be between 50 GeV and 106 GeV. The remaining same- ﬂavour, opposite-charge lepton pair is the sub-leading lepton pair. Its invariant mass, m34, is required to be in the range mmin<m34<115 GeV, where the value ofmmindepends on the reconstructed four-lepton in- variant mass, m4ℓ. The value of mminvaries monoton- ically from 17 .5 GeV at m4ℓ=120 GeV to 50 GeV atm4ℓ=190 GeV [87] and is constant above this value. All possible lepton pairs in the quadruplet that have the same ﬂavour and opposite charge must satisfy mℓℓ>5 GeV in order to reject backgrounds involving theproductionanddecayof J/ψmesons. Iftwoormore quadrupletssatisfytheaboveselection,theonewiththe highest value of m34is selected. Four di ﬀerent analysis sub-channels, 4 e, 2e2µ, 2µ2eand 4µ, arranged by the ﬂavourofthe leadingleptonpair,are deﬁned. Non-promptleptonsfromheavyﬂavourdecays,elec- trons from photon conversions and jets mis-identiﬁed as electrons have broader transverse impact parameter distributions than prompt leptons from Zboson decays and/or are non-isolated. Thus, the Z+jets and t¯tback- ground contributions are reduced by applying a cut on thetransverseimpactparametersigniﬁcance,deﬁnedas the transverse impact parameter divided by its uncer- tainty, d0/σd0. This is requiredto be less than 3.5 (6.5) formuons(electrons). Theelectronimpactparameteris aﬀected by bremsstrahlung and thus has a broader dis- tribution. In addition, leptons must satisfy isolation require- ments based on tracking and calorimetric information. The normalised track isolation discriminant is deﬁned as the sum of the transversemomentaof tracksinside a cone of size∆R=0.2 around the lepton direction, ex- cluding the lepton track, divided by the lepton pT. The tracks considered in the sum are those compatible with theleptonvertexandhave pT>0.4 GeV( pT>1 GeV) in the case of electron (muon) candidates. Each lepton is required to have a normalised track isolation smaller than
0.15. The normalised calorimetric isolation for electrons is computedas the sum of the ETof positive- energy topological clusters [88] with a reconstructed barycentrefallingwithinaconeofsize ∆R=0.2around the candidate electron cluster, divided by the electron ET. Thealgorithmfortopologicalclusteringsuppresses noise by keepingcells with a signiﬁcant energydeposit and their neighbours. The summed energy of the cells assignedtotheelectronclusterisexcluded,whileacor- rectionis appliedto accountforthe electronenergyde- posited outsidethe cluster. The ambientenergydeposi- 4 tion in the event from pile-up and the underlying event isaccountedforusingacalculationofthemediantrans- verseenergydensityfromlow- pTjets[89,90]. Thenor- malised calorimetric isolation for electrons is required to be less than 0.20. The normalisedcalorimetricisola- tiondiscriminantformuonsisdeﬁnedbytheratiotothe pTof the muon of the ETsum of the calorimeter cells inside a cone of size ∆R=0.2 around the muon direc- tion minus the energy deposited by the muon. Muons are requiredto have a normalisedcalorimetricisolation lessthan0.30(0.15formuonswithoutanassociatedID track). For both the track- and calorimeter-basedisola- tion,anycontributionsarising fromotherleptonsofthe quadrupletare subtracted. Thecombinedsignalreconstructionandselectionef- ﬁciencies for a SM Higgs with mH=125 GeV for the 7 TeV (8 TeV) data are 37% (36%) for the 4 µchannel, 20%(22%)forthe2 e2µ/2µ2echannelsand15%(20%) forthe4 echannel. The 4ℓinvariant mass resolution is improved by ap- plyinga Z-massconstrainedkinematicﬁttotheleading leptonpair for m4ℓ<190 GeV and to bothlepton pairs for higher masses. The expected width of the recon- structed mass distribution is dominated by the experi- mental resolution for mH<350 GeV, and by the natu- ralwidthoftheHiggsbosonforhighermasses(30 GeV atmH=400 GeV). The typical mass resolutions for mH=125 GeV are 1 .7 GeV, 1.7 GeV/2.2 GeV and 2.3 GeVforthe4 µ,2e2µ/2µ2eand4 esub-channels,re- spectively. 4.2. Background estimation The expected backgroundyield and composition are estimated using the MC simulation normalised to the theoretical cross section for ZZ(∗)production and by methodsusingcontrolregionsfromdataforthe Z+jets andt¯tprocesses. Sincethebackgroundcompositionde- pendson the ﬂavour of the sub-leadinglepton pair, dif- ferentapproachesaretakenforthe ℓℓ+µµandtheℓℓ+ee ﬁnal states. The transfer factors needed to extrapolate the backgroundyields from the control regions deﬁned below to the signal region are obtained from the MC simulation. The MC description of the
selection e ﬃ- ciencies for the di ﬀerent background components has beenveriﬁedwith data. Thereducible ℓℓ+µµbackgroundisdominatedby t¯t andZ+jets(mostly Zb¯b)events. Acontrolregionisde- ﬁnedby removingthe isolationrequirementon the lep- tonsinthesub-leadingpair,andbyrequiringthatatleast oneofthesub-leadingmuonsfailsthetransverseimpact parameter signiﬁcance selection. These modiﬁcations remove ZZ(∗)contributions, and allow both the t¯tandZ+jetsbackgroundstobeestimatedsimultaneouslyus- ing a ﬁt to the m12distribution. The t¯tbackgroundcon- tributioniscross-checkedbyselectinga controlsample ofeventswithanoppositecharge eµpairwithaninvari- ant mass between 50 GeV and 106 GeV, accompanied by an opposite-chargemuon pair. Eventswith a Zcan- didate decaying to a pair of electrons or muons in the aforementionedmass range are excluded. Isolation and transverse impact parameter signiﬁcance requirements areappliedonlytotheleptonsofthe eµpair. Inordertoestimatethereducible ℓℓ+eebackground, a controlregionis formedby relaxingthe selection cri- teriafortheelectronsofthesub-leadingpair. Thedi ﬀer- ent sources of electron background are then separated into categories consisting of non-prompt leptons from heavy ﬂavour decays, electrons from photon conver- sions and jets mis-identiﬁed as electrons, using appro- priatediscriminatingvariables[91]. Thismethodallows the sum of the Z+jets and t¯tbackgroundcontributions to be estimated. As a cross-check, the same method is alsoappliedtoasimilarcontrolregioncontainingsame- charge sub-leading electron pairs.

Systematic uncertainties The uncertainties on the integrated luminosities are determined to be 1.8% for the 7 TeV data and 3.6% for the 8 TeV data using the techniques described in Ref.[92]. The uncertainties on the lepton reconstruction and identiﬁcation eﬃciencies and on the momentum scale and resolution are determined using samples of W, Zand J/ψdecays [84, 85]. The relative uncertainty on the signal acceptance due to the uncertainty on the muon reconstruction and identiﬁcation e ﬃciency is ±0.7% (±0.5%/±0.5%) for the 4 µ(2e2µ/2µ2e) chan- nel for m4ℓ=600 GeV and increases to ±0.9% (±0.8%/±0.5%) for m4ℓ=115 GeV. Similarly, the relative uncertainty on the signal acceptance due to the uncertainty on the electron reconstruction and identiﬁ- cation eﬃciency is±2.6% (±1.7%/±1.8%) for the 4 e (2e2µ/2µ2e) channel for m4ℓ=600 GeV and reaches ±8.0% (±2.3%/±7.6%) for m4ℓ=115 GeV. The un- certainty on the electron energy scale results in an un- certainty of±0.7% (±0.5%/±0.2%) on the mass scale of the m4ℓdistribution for the 4 e(2e2µ/2µ2e) channel. The impact of the uncertainties on the electron energyresolution and on the muon momentum resolution and scale arefoundto benegligible. The theoretical uncertaintiesassociated with the sig- nal are described in detail in Section 8. For the SM ZZ(∗)background,whichisestimatedfromMCsimula- tion, the uncertainty on the total yield due to the QCD scale uncertainty is ±5%, while
the eﬀect of the PDF andαsuncertainties is±4% (±8%) for processes initi- ated by quarks (gluons) [53]. In addition, the depen- denceoftheseuncertaintiesonthefour-leptoninvariant massspectrumhasbeentakenintoaccountasdiscussed in Ref. [53]. Though a small excess of events is ob- served for m4l>160 GeV, the measured ZZ(∗)→4ℓ cross section [93] is consistent with the SM theoreti- cal prediction.

The dominant background is SM diphoton production ( γγ); contributions also come fromγ+jet and jet+jet production with one or two jets mis-identiﬁedasphotons( γjandj j)andfromtheDrell- Yanprocess. The7 TeVdatahavebeenre-analysedand the results combined with those from the 8TeV data. Among other changes to the analysis, a new category of events with two jets is introduced, which enhancesthe sensitivity to the VBF process. Higgs boson events produced by the VBF process have two forward jets, originating from the two scattered quarks, and tend to be devoidof jets in the central region. Overall,the sen- sitivityoftheanalysishasbeenimprovedbyabout20% withrespectto thatdescribedinRef.[95]. 5.1. Event selection The data used in this channel are selected using a diphoton trigger [96], which requires two clusters formed from energy depositions in the electromagnetic calorimeter. An ETthreshold of 20GeV is applied to each cluster for the 7TeV data, while for the 8 TeV datathethresholdsareincreasedto35GeVonthelead- ing (the highest ET) cluster and to 25GeV on the sub- leading (the next-highest ET) cluster. In addition, loose criteriaareappliedtotheshapesoftheclusterstomatch the expectations for electromagnetic showers initiated by photons. The eﬃciencyof the triggeris greaterthan 99%foreventspassingtheﬁnaleventselection. Events are required to contain at least one recon- structed vertex with at least two
associated tracks with pT>0.4 GeV, as well as two photon candidates. Pho- ton candidates are reconstructed in the ﬁducial region |η|<2.37, excluding the calorimeter barrel /end-cap transitionregion1 .37≤|η|<1.52. Photonsthatconvert to electron-positron pairs in the ID material can have one or two reconstructedtracks matched to the clusters inthecalorimeter. Thephotonreconstructione ﬃciency isabout97%for ET>30GeV. In orderto accountfor energylosses upstreamof the calorimeter and energy leakage outside of the cluster, MCsimulationresultsareusedtocalibratetheenergies ofthephotoncandidates;thereareseparatecalibrations for unconvertedand convertedcandidates. The calibra- tion is reﬁned by applying η-dependent correction fac- tors, which are of the order of ±1%, determined from measured Z→e+e−events. The leading (sub-leading) photon candidate is required to have ET>40 GeV (30GeV). Photon candidates are required to pass identiﬁcation criteria based on shower shapes in the electromagnetic calorimeter and on energy leakage into the hadronic calorimeter[97]. Forthe7 TeVdata,thisinformationis combined in a neural network, tuned to achieve a sim- ilar jet rejection as the cut-based selection described in Ref. [95], but with higher photon e ﬃciency. For the 8TeVdata,cut-basedcriteriaareusedtoensurereliable photon performance for recently-recorded data. This cut-based selection has been tuned to be robust against pile-up by relaxing requirements on shower shape cri- teria moresusceptible to pile-up, and tighteningothers. 7 The photon identiﬁcation e ﬃciencies, averaged over η, range from 85% to above 95% for the ETrange under consideration. To further suppress the jet background, an isolation requirement is applied. The isolation transverse en- ergy is deﬁned as the sum of the transverse energy of positive-energy topological clusters, as described in Section 4, within a cone of size ∆R=0.4 around the photon candidate, excluding the region within 0 .125× 0.175in∆η×∆φaroundthephotonbarycentre. Thedis- tributions of the isolation transverse energy in data and simulationhavebeenfoundtobeingoodagreementus- ing electrons from Z→e+e−events and photons from Z→ℓ+ℓ−γevents. Remaining small di ﬀerences are taken into account as a systematic uncertainty. Photon candidates are required to have an isolation transverse
energyoflessthan4GeV. 5.2. Invariant mass reconstruction Theinvariantmassofthetwophotonsisevaluatedus- ingthephotonenergiesmeasuredinthecalorimeter,the azimuthal angle φbetween the photons as determined fromthepositionsofthephotonsinthecalorimeter,and thevaluesof ηcalculatedfromthepositionoftheidenti- ﬁedprimaryvertexandtheimpactpointsofthephotons inthecalorimeter. The primary vertex of the hard interaction is identi- ﬁedbycombiningthefollowinginformationinaglobal likelihood: the directions of ﬂight of the photons as determined using the longitudinal segmentation of the electromagnetic calorimeter (calorimeter pointing), the parametersofthe beamspot,andthe/summationtextp2 Tofthetracks associated with each reconstructed vertex. In addition, for the 7TeV data analysis, the reconstructed conver- sion vertex is used in the likelihood for converted pho- tons with tracks containing hits in the silicon layers of the ID. The calorimeter pointing is su ﬃcient to ensure that the contribution of the opening angle between the photons to the mass resolution is negligible. Using the calorimeterpointingalone,theresolutionofthevertex z coordinateis∼15mm, improvingto ∼6mm for events withtworeconstructedconvertedphotons. Thetracking information from the ID improves the identiﬁcation of the vertex of the hard interaction, which is needed for thejet selectionin the2-jetcategory. With the selection described in Section 5.1, in the diphoton invariant mass range between 100GeV and 160GeV,23788and35251diphotoncandidatesareob- served in the 7 TeV and 8TeV data samples, respec- tively. Data-driven techniques [98] are used to estimate the numbers of γγ,γjand j jevents in the selected sam-ple. The contribution from the Drell-Yan background isdeterminedfromasampleof Z→e+e−decaysindata whereeitheroneorbothelectronspassthephotonselec- tion. The measuredcompositionof the selected sample is approximately74%,22%,3% and1% for the γγ,γj, j jandDrell-Yanprocesses,respectively,demonstrating the dominance of the irreducible diphoton production. This decomposition is not directly used in the signal search;however,itisusedtostudytheparameterisation ofthebackgroundmodelling. 5.3. Event categorisation To increase the sensitivity to a Higgs boson signal, theeventsareseparatedintotenmutuallyexclusivecat- egorieshaving diﬀerentmass resolutionsand signal-to- backgroundratios. Anexclusivecategoryofeventscon- taining two jets improves the sensitivity to VBF. The other nine categoriesare deﬁned by the presence or not ofconvertedphotons, ηoftheselectedphotons,and pTt, thecomponent3ofthediphoton pTthatisorthogonalto the axisdeﬁnedby the di ﬀerencebetween the two pho- tonmomenta[99, 100]. Jets are reconstructed [101] using the anti- ktalgo- rithm [102] with radius parameter R=0.4. At least
two jets with|η|<4.5 and pT>25 GeV are re- quiredinthe2-jetselection. Intheanalysisofthe8 TeV data, the pTthreshold is raised to 30GeV for jets with 2.5<|η|<4.5. ForjetsintheIDacceptance( |η|<2.5), the fraction of the sum of the pTof tracks, associated withthe jet andmatchedtotheselected primaryvertex, with respect to the sum of the pTof tracks associated with the jet (jet vertex fraction, JVF) is required to be at least 0.75. This requirement on the JVF reduces the numberofjetsfromproton-protoninteractionsnotasso- ciated with the primary vertex. Motivated by the VBF topology, three additional cuts are applied in the 2-jet selection: the diﬀerence of the pseudorapiditybetween the leading and sub-leading jets (tag jets) is requiredto be larger than 2 .8, the invariant mass of the tag jets has to be largerthan 400GeV, and the azimuthal angle dif- ferencebetweenthe diphotonsystem andthe system of the tag jets has to be larger than 2 .6. About 70% of the signal events in the 2-jet category come from the VBF process. The other nine categories are deﬁned as follows: eventswith two unconvertedphotonsare separatedinto unconverted central (|η|<0.75forbothcandidates)and unconverted rest (all other events), events with at least 3pTt=/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle(pγ1 T+pγ2 T)×(pγ1 T−pγ2 T)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle//vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglepγ1 T−pγ2 T/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle,where pγ1 Tandpγ2 T are thetransverse momenta of the two photons. 8 Table 4: Number of events in the data ( ND) and expected number of signalevents ( NS)for mH=126.5GeVfromthe H→γγanalysis, for each category in the mass range 100 −160 GeV.

Except for the con- verted transition category, each category is further di- vided by a cut at pTt=60 GeV into two categories, low pTtandhigh p Tt. MC studies show that signal events, particularly those producedvia VBF or associated pro- duction ( WH/ZHandt¯tH), have on average larger pTt than background events. The number of data events in each category, as well as the sum of all the categories, whichisdenoted inclusive,aregiveninTable4. 5.4. Signal modelling ThedescriptionoftheHiggsbosonsignalisobtained fromMC, as describedin Section 3. The crosssections multiplied by the branching ratio into two photons are given in Table 4 for mH=126.5 GeV. The number of signal events produced via the ggF process is rescaled to take into account the expected destructive interfer- encebetweenthe gg→γγcontinuumbackgroundand ggF [103], leadingto a reductionof the productionrate by 2−5% dependingon mHand the event category. For both the 7TeV and 8TeV MC samples, the fractions of ggF, VBF, WH,ZHandt¯tHproduction are approxi- mately 88%, 7%, 3%, 2% and 0 .5%, respectively, for mH=126.5GeV. In the simulation, the shower shape distributions are shifted slightly to improve the agreement with the data [97], and the photon energy resolution is broad- ened (by approximately 1% in the barrel calorimeterand 1.2−2.1% in the end-cap regions) to account for small diﬀerences observed between Z→e+e−data and MC events. The signal yields expected for the 7 TeV and 8TeV data samples are givenin Table

The shape of the invariantmass of the signal in each categoryismodelledby thesum ofa Crystal Ball func- tion [104], describing the core of the distribution with a widthσCB, and a Gaussian contribution describing the tails (amountingto <10%) of the mass distribution. The expected full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) is 3.9 GeV and σCBis 1.6 GeV for the inclusive sample. Theresolutionvarieswitheventcategory(seeTable 4); theFWHM istypicallyafactor2.3largerthan σCB. 5.5. Background modelling The background in each category is estimated from data by ﬁtting the diphoton mass spectrum in the mass range100−160GeVwithaselectedmodelwithfreepa- rameters of shape and normalisation. Di ﬀerent models arechosenforthedi ﬀerentcategoriestoachieveagood compromisebetweenlimitingthesizeofapotentialbias while retaining good statistical power. A fourth-order Bernstein polynomialfunction[105] is used forthe un- converted rest (low pTt),converted rest (low pTt)and in- clusivecategories,an exponentialfunctionofa second- orderpolynomialfor the unconverted central (low pTt), converted central (low pTt)and converted transition cat- egories,andanexponentialfunctionforallothers. Studiestodeterminethepotentialbiashavebeenper- formed using large samples of simulated background events complemented by data-driven estimates. The background shapes in the simulation have been cross- checked using data from control regions. The poten- tial bias for a given model is estimated, separately for each category,by performinga maximumlikelihoodﬁt to large samples of simulated backgroundevents in the mass range 100−160 GeV, of the sum of a signal plus the given backgroundmodel. The signal shape is taken tofollowtheexpectationforaSMHiggsboson;thesig- nalyieldisafreeparameteroftheﬁt. Thepotentialbias is deﬁned by the largest absolute signal yield obtained fromthelikelihoodﬁttothesimulatedbackgroundsam- ples for hypothesised Higgs boson masses in the range 110−150 GeV. A pre-selection of background parame- terisations is made by requiring that the potential bias, as deﬁned above, is less than 20% of the statistical un- certaintyonthe ﬁtted signalyield. The pre-selectedpa- rameterisation in each category with the best expected sensitivity for mH=125GeV is selected as the back- groundmodel. 9 The largest absolute signal yield as deﬁned above is taken as the systematic uncertainty on the background model. Itamountsto ±(0.2−4.6)and±(0.3−6.8)events, dependingonthecategoryforthe7TeVand8TeVdata
samples, respectively. In the ﬁnal ﬁt to the data (see Section 5.7) a signal-like term is included in the likeli- hoodfunctionforeachcategory. Thistermincorporates the estimated potential bias, thus providinga conserva- tive estimate of the uncertainty due to the background modelling. 5.6. Systematic uncertainties Hereafter, in cases where two uncertainties are quoted, they refer to the 7TeV and 8 TeV data, respec- tively. The dominant experimental uncertainty on the signal yield (±8%,±11%) comes from the photon re- construction and identiﬁcation e ﬃciency, which is es- timated with data using electrons from Zdecays and photons from Z→ℓ+ℓ−γevents. Pile-up modelling also aﬀects the expected yields and contributes to the uncertainty (±4%). Further uncertainties on the sig- nal yield are related to the trigger ( ±1%), photonisola- tion (±0.4%,±0.5%) and luminosity ( ±1.8%,±3.6%). Uncertainties due to the modelling of the underlying event are±6% for VBF and±30% for other produc- tionprocessesinthe2-jetcategory. Uncertaintiesonthe predicted cross sections and branching ratio are sum- marisedin Section8. The uncertainty on the expected fractions of signal events in each category is described in the following. The uncertainty on the knowledge of the material in front of the calorimeter is used to derive the amount of possibleeventmigrationbetweentheconvertedandun- convertedcategories( ±4%). Theuncertaintyfrompile- up on the population of the converted and unconverted categoriesis±2%. The uncertainty from the jet energy scale (JES) amounts to up to ±19% for the 2-jet cate- gory,andupto±4%fortheothercategories. Uncertain- ties from the JVF modelling are ±12% (for the 8TeV data) for the 2-jet category, estimated from Z+2-jets events by comparingdata and MC. Di ﬀerent PDFs and scale variations in the HqTcalculations are used to de- rive possible event migration among categories ( ±9%) dueto themodellingoftheHiggsbosonkinematics. Thetotaluncertaintyonthemassresolutionis ±14%. Thedominantcontribution( ±12%)comesfromthe un- certainty on the energy resolution of the calorimeter, which is determined from Z→e+e−events.

The values Si/Bi haveonlyamilddependenceon mH. The statistical
interpretation of the excess of events near mγγ=126.5 GeV in Fig. 4 is presented in Sec- tion9. 6.H→WW(∗)→eνµνchannel Thesignatureforthischannelistwoopposite-charge leptons with large transverse momentum and a large momentum imbalance in the event due to the escaping neutrinos. The dominantbackgroundsarenon-resonant WW,t¯t, and Wtproduction, all of which have real Wpairsin the ﬁnal state. Other importantbackgrounds include Drell-Yan events ( pp→Z/γ(∗)→ℓℓ) with Emiss T that may arise from mismeasurement, W+jets events in which a jet produces an object reconstructed as the second electron or muon, and Wγevents in which the photon undergoes a conversion. Boson pair produc- tion ( Wγ∗/WZ(∗)andZZ(∗)) can also produceopposite- charge lepton pairs with additional leptons that are not detected. The analysis of the 8 TeV data presented here is fo- cused on the mass range 110 <mH<200GeV. It fol- lows the procedure used for the 7 TeV data, described in Ref. [106], exceptthat morestringentcriteria are ap- pliedto reducethe W+jetsbackgroundandsomeselec- tions have been modiﬁed to mitigate the impact of the higherinstantaneousluminosityat theLHC in 2012. In particular,thehigherluminosityresultsinalargerDrell - Yan backgroundto the same-ﬂavour ﬁnal states, due to the deterioration of the missing transverse momentum resolution. Forthisreason,andthe fact that the eµﬁnal state provides more than 85% of the sensitivity of the search, the same-ﬂavourﬁnal states have not been used intheanalysisdescribedhere. 6.1. Event selection For the 8 TeV H→WW(∗)→eνµνsearch, the data are selected using inclusive single-muon and single- electron triggers. Both triggers require an isolated lep- ton with pT>24GeV. Quality criteria are applied to suppress non-collision backgroundssuch as cosmic- ray muons, beam-related backgrounds, and noise in the calorimeters. The primary vertex selection fol- lows that described in Section 4. Candidates for the H→WW(∗)→eνµνsearch are pre-selected by requir- ing exactly two opposite-charge leptons of di ﬀerent ﬂavours, with pTthresholds of 25 GeV for the leadinglepton and 15 GeV for the sub-leading lepton. Events are classiﬁed
into two exclusive lepton channels de- pending on the ﬂavour of the leading lepton, where eµ (µe)referstoeventswithaleadingelectron(muon). The dilepton invariant mass is required to be greater than 10GeV. The lepton selection and isolation have more strin- gentrequirementsthanthoseusedforthe H→ZZ(∗)→ 4ℓanalysis (see Section 4), to reduce the larger back- groundfromnon-promptleptonsin the ℓνℓνﬁnal state. Electroncandidatesareselectedusinga combinationof tracking and calorimetric information [85]; the criteria are optimised for background rejection, at the expense of some reduced e ﬃciency. Muon candidates are re- stricted to those with matching MS and ID tracks [84], and therefore are reconstructed over |η|<2.5. The isolation criteria require the scalar sums of the pTof charged particles and of calorimeter topological clus- ters within∆R=0.3 of the lepton direction (excluding theleptonitself)eachtobelessthan0.12-0.20timesthe lepton pT. The exact value di ﬀers between the criteria for tracks and calorimeter clusters, for both electrons and muons, and depends on the lepton pT. Jet selec- tions follow those described in Section 5.3, except that theJVF isrequiredtobegreaterthan0.5. Since two neutrinos are present in the signal ﬁnal state, events are required to have large Emiss T.Emiss Tis the negative vector sum of the transverse momenta of the reconstructed objects, including muons, electrons, photons, jets, and clusters of calorimeter cells not as- sociated with these objects. The quantity Emiss T,relused in this analysis is required to be greater than 25 GeV and is deﬁned as: Emiss T,rel=Emiss Tsin∆φmin, where∆φmin is min(∆φ,π 2), and Emiss Tis the magnitude of the vec- torEmiss T. Here,∆φis the angle between Emiss Tand the transverse momentum of the nearest lepton or jet with pT>25 GeV. Compared to Emiss T,Emiss T,relhas increased rejection power for events in which the Emiss Tis gener- ated by a neutrinoin a jet or the mismeasurementof an object, since in those events the Emiss Ttends to point in thedirectionoftheobject. Aftertheleptonisolationand Emiss T,relrequirements that
deﬁne the pre-selected sample, the multijet backgroundis negligibleand the Drell-Yan background is much reduced. The Drell-Yan contribu- tionbecomesverysmallafterthetopologicalselections, describedbelow,areapplied. Thebackgroundrateandcompositiondependsignif- icantly on the jet multiplicity, as does the signal topol- ogy. Without accompanying jets, the signal originates almost entirely from the ggF process and the back- ground is dominated by WWevents. In contrast, when 11 producedinassociationwithtwoormorejets,thesignal contains a much larger contributionfrom the VBF pro- cess compared to the ggF process, and the background is dominated by ttproduction. Therefore, to maximise thesensitivitytoSMHiggsevents,furtherselectioncri- teriadependingonthejetmultiplicityareappliedtothe pre-selectedsample. Thedata aresubdividedinto0-jet, 1-jet and 2-jet search channels according to the num- ber of jets in the ﬁnal state, with the 2-jet channel also includinghigherjet multiplicities. Owingto spin correlationsin the WW(∗)system aris- ing from the spin-0 nature of the SM Higgs boson and the V-A structure of the Wboson decay vertex, the charged leptons tend to emerge from the primary ver- texpointinginthesamedirection[107]. Thiskinematic featureisexploitedforalljetmultiplicitiesbyrequirin g that|∆φℓℓ|<1.8, and the dilepton invariant mass, mℓℓ, belessthan50GeVforthe0-jetand1-jetchannels. For the 2-jet channel, the mℓℓupper bound is increased to 80GeV. In the 0-jet channel, the magnitude pℓℓ Tof the trans- versemomentumofthedileptonsystem, pℓℓ T=pℓ1 T+pℓ2 T, isrequiredtobegreaterthan30GeV.Thisimprovesthe rejectionoftheDrell-Yanbackground. Inthe1-jetchannel,backgroundsfromtopquarkpro- ductionare suppressed by rejecting events containinga b-taggedjet, as determinedusinga b-taggingalgorithm that uses a neural network and exploits the topology of weakdecaysof b-and c-hadrons[108]. Thetotal trans- verse momentum, ptot T, deﬁned as the magnitude of the vector sum ptot T=pℓ1 T+pℓ2 T+pj T+Emiss T, is required to be smaller than 30 GeV to suppress top background eventsthathavejetswith pTbelowthethresholddeﬁned forjet counting. In order to reject the backgroundfrom Z→ττ, theττinvariant mass, mττ, is computed under theassumptionsthatthereconstructedleptonsare τlep- ton decay products. In addition the neutrinos produced in these decays are assumed to be the only source of Emiss Tand to be collinear with the leptons[109]. Events with|mττ−mZ|<25 GeV are rejected if the collinear approximationyieldsaphysicalsolution. The 2-jet selection follows the 1-jet
selection de- scribed above, with the ptot Tdeﬁnition modiﬁed to in- clude all selected jets. Motivated by the VBF topol- ogy, several additional criteria are applied to the tag jets, deﬁned as the two highest- pTjets in the event. These are required to be separated in rapidity by a dis- tance|∆yj j|>3.8 and to have an invariant mass, mj j, largerthan 500 GeV. Eventswith an additional jet with pT>20 GeV between the tag jets ( yj1<y<yj2) are rejected.A transverse mass variable, mT[110], is used to test forthepresenceofasignalforalljetmultiplicities. This variableisdeﬁnedas: mT=/radicalBig (Eℓℓ T+Emiss T)2−|pℓℓ T+Emiss T|2, where Eℓℓ T=/radicalBig |pℓℓ T|2+m2 ℓℓ. The statistical analysis of thedata usesa ﬁt to the mTdistributioninthe signalre- gionafterthe∆φℓℓrequirement(seeSection6.4),which resultsin increasedsensitivity comparedto the analysis describedinRef. [111]. For a SM Higgs boson with mH=125GeV, the cross section times branching ratio to the eνµνﬁnal state is 88fb for√s=7TeV, increasing to 112 fb at√s=8TeV. The combined acceptancetimes e ﬃciency of the 8TeV 0-jet and1-jet selection relativeto the ggF production cross section times branching ratio is about 7.4%. Theacceptancetimese ﬃciencyofthe8TeV2-jet selection relative to the VBF production cross section times branching ratio is about 14%. Both of these ﬁg- ures are based on the number of events selected before the ﬁnal mTcriterion is applied (as described in Sec- tion6.4). 6.2. Background normalisation and control samples TheleadingbackgroundsfromSMprocessesproduc- ing two isolated high- pTleptons are WWand top (in this section, “top” background always includes both t¯t and single top, unless otherwise noted). These are es- timated using partially data-driventechniquesbased on normalising the MC predictions to the data in control regions dominated by the relevant background source. TheW+jetsbackgroundisestimatedfromdataforalljet multiplicities. Only the small backgroundsfrom Drell- Yan and diboson processes other than WW, as well as theWWbackgroundforthe2-jetanalysis,areestimated usingMCsimulation. The control and validationregionsare deﬁnedby se- lections similar to those used for the signal region but withsomecriteriareversedormodiﬁedtoobtainsignal- depleted samples

Theterm“validationregion”distinguishestheseregions from the control regions that are used to directly nor- malisethebackgrounds.Somecontrolregionshavesig- niﬁcant contributions from backgrounds other than the targetedone,whichintroducesdependenciesamongthe background estimates. These correlations are fully in- corporated in the ﬁt to the mTdistribution. In the fol- lowingsections, each backgroundestimate is described afteranyothersonwhichit depends. Hence,thelargest background( WW)isdescribedlast. 12 6.2.1. W+jets background estimation TheW+jetsbackgroundcontributionisestimatedus- ingacontrolsampleofeventswhereoneofthetwolep- tonssatisﬁes the identiﬁcationand isolation criteria de- scribed in Section 6.1, and the other lepton fails these criteriabutsatisﬁesaloosenedselection(denoted“anti- identiﬁed”). Otherwise, events in this sample are re- quired to pass all the signal selections. The dominant contribution to this sample comes from W+jets events in which a jet produces an object that is reconstructed asa lepton. Thisobject maybe either a trueelectron or muonfromthedecayofaheavyquark,orelseaproduct ofthefragmentationidentiﬁedasaleptoncandidate. Thecontaminationinthesignalregionisobtainedby scaling the number of events in the data control sam- ple by a transfer factor. The transfer factor is deﬁned hereas the ratio of the numberof identiﬁedlepton can- didates passing all selections to the number of anti- identiﬁed leptons. It is calculated as a function of the anti-identiﬁedlepton pTusingadatasampledominated by QCD jet production (dijet sample) after subtracting theresidualcontributionsfromleptonsproducedbylep- tonic WandZdecays, as estimated from data. The small remaining lepton contamination, which includes Wγ(∗)/WZ(∗)events,issubtractedusingMCsimulation. Theprocessesproducingthemajorityofsame-charge dilepton events, W+jets, Wγ(∗)/WZ(∗)andZ(∗)Z(∗), are all backgrounds in the opposite-charge signal region. W+jets and Wγ(∗)backgrounds are particularly impor- tant in a search optimised for a low Higgs boson mass hypothesis. Therefore,the normalisationandkinematic featuresofsame-chargedileptoneventsareusedto val- idate the predictions of these backgrounds. The pre- dictednumberofsame-chargeeventsafterthe Emiss T,reland zero-jetrequirementsis216 ±7(stat)±42(syst),while 182eventsare observedin the data. Satisfactoryagree- ment between data and simulation is observed in vari- ouskinematicdistributions,includingthoseof ∆φℓℓ(see Fig.5(a))andthetransversemass. 6.2.2. Top control sample Inthe0-jetchannel,thetopquarkbackgroundpredic- tion is ﬁrst normalised using events satisfying the pre- selection criteria described in Section 6.1. This sample isselectedwithoutjetmultiplicityor b-taggingrequire- ments, and the majority of events contain top quarks. Non-top contributions are subtracted using predictions fromsimulation, exceptfor
W+jets, which is estimated using data. After this normalisation is performed, the fraction of events with zero jets that pass all selections isevaluated.

The eµandµeﬁnal states are combined. The hashed area indicates the total uncertainty on the background prediction. The expect ed signal formH=125 GeV is negligible and therefore not visible. 1. Predictions of this fraction from MC simulation are sensitive to theoretical uncertainties such as the mod- elling of initial- and ﬁnal-state radiation, as well as ex- perimental uncertainties, especially that on the jet en- ergy scale. To reduce the impact of these uncertainties, the top quarkbackgrounddeterminationuses data from ab-taggedcontrolregioninwhichtheone-to-twojetra- tioiscomparedtotheMCsimulation [112].

Thesmallcontributionsfrom other sources are taken into account using MC simula- tion and the data-driven W+jets estimate. Good agree- ment
between data and MC simulation is observed for the total numbers of events and the shapes of the mT distributions. The resulting normalisation factors are 1.11±0.05 for the 1-jet control region and 1 .01±0.26 for the 2-jet control region. Only the statistical uncer- taintiesarequoted. 6.2.3. WW control sample The MC predictions of the WWbackground in the 0-jet and 1-jet analyses, summed over lepton ﬂavours, are normalised using control regions deﬁned with the same selections as for the signal region except that the ∆φℓℓrequirement is removed and the upper bound on mℓℓisreplacedwithalowerbound: mℓℓ>80 GeV. The numbers of events and the shape of the mTdistribution in the control regions are in good agreement between data and MC, as shown in Fig. 5(b). WWproduction contributesabout 70% of the eventsin the 0-jet control region and about 45% in the 1-jet region.

Systematic uncertainties Thesystematicuncertaintiesthathavethelargestim- pact on the sensitivity of the search are the theoretical uncertainties associated with the signal. These are de- scribed in Section 9. The main experimentaluncertain- ties are associated with the JES, the jet energy resolu- tion (JER), pile-up, Emiss T, the b-tagging eﬃciency, the W+jets transfer factor, and the integrated luminosity. The largest uncertainties on the backgrounds include WWnormalisation and modelling, top normalisation, andWγ(∗)normalisation. The 2-jet systematic uncer- tainties are dominated by the statistical uncertainties in the data and the MC simulation, and are therefore not discussedfurther. Variations of the jet energy scale within the system- atic uncertainties can cause events to migrate between the jet bins. The uncertainty on the JES varies from ±2% to±9% as a function of jet pTandηfor jets with pT>25GeV and|η|<4.5[101]. The largestimpact of this uncertainty on the total signal (background) yieldamounts to 7% (4%) in the 0-jet
(1-jet) bin. The un- certainty on the JER is estimated from in situmeasure- ments and it impacts mostly the 1-jet channel, where its eﬀect on the total signal and background yields is 4% and 2%, respectively. An additional contributionto theJESuncertaintyarisesfrompile-up,andisestimated to vary between±1% and±5% for multiple ppcolli- sions in the same bunch crossing and up to ±10% for neighbouringbunch crossings. This uncertainty a ﬀects mainly the 1-jet channel, where its impact on the sig- nal and background yields is 4% and 2%, respectively. JESandleptonmomentumscaleuncertaintiesareprop- agated to the Emiss Tmeasurement. Additional contri- butions to the Emiss Tuncertainties arise from jets with pT<20GeVandfromlow-energycalorimeterdeposits notassociatedwithreconstructedphysicsobjects[113]. The impact of the Emiss Tuncertainty on the total signal and backgroundyields is ∼3%. The eﬃciencyof the b- tagging algorithm is calibrated using samples contain- ing muons reconstructed in the vicinity of jets [114]. Theuncertaintyonthe b-jettaggingeﬃciencyvariesbe- tween±5% and±18% as a function of the jet pT, and its impact on the total backgroundyield is 10% for the 1-jet channel. The uncertainty in the W+jets transfer factor is dominated by di ﬀerences in jet properties be- tween dijet and W+jets events as observed in MC sim- ulations. The total uncertainty on this background is approximately±40%,resultinginanuncertaintyonthe total background yield of 5%. The uncertainty on the integratedluminosityis ±3.6%. A ﬁt to the distribution of mTis performed in or- der to obtain the signal yield for each mass hypoth- esis (see Section 6.4). Most theoretical and experi- mental uncertainties do not produce statistically signif- icant changes to the mTdistribution. The uncertainties that do produce signiﬁcant changes of the distribution ofmThave no appreciable e ﬀect on the ﬁnal results, with the exception of those associated with the WW background. In this case, an uncertainty is included to take into account di ﬀerences in the distribution of mT and normalisation observed between the MCFM [115],
MC@NLO+HERWIG and POWHEG +PYTHIA gen- erators. The potential impact of interference between resonant (Higgs-mediated) and non-resonant gg→WW diagrams[116]for mT>mHwasinvestigatedandfound to be negligible. The e ﬀect of the WWnormalisation, modelling, and shape systematics on the total back- ground yield is 9% for the 0-jet channel and 19% for the 1-jet channel. The uncertainty on the shape of the total background is dominated by the uncertainties on the normalisations of the individual backgrounds. The main uncertainties on the top background in the 0-jet 14 analysis include those associated with interference ef- fectsbetween t¯tandsingletop,initialstateanﬁnalstate radiation, b-tagging, and JER. The impact on the total background yield in the 0-jet bin is 3%. For the 1-jet analysis, the impact of the top background on the to- tal yield is 14%. Theoretical uncertainties on the Wγ backgroundnormalisationareevaluatedforeachjet bin using the procedure described in Ref. [117]. They are ±11% for the 0-jet bin and ±50% for the 1-jet bin. For Wγ∗with mℓℓ<7GeV,ak-factorof1 .3±0.3isapplied to the MadGraph LO prediction based on the compari- son with the MCFM NLO calculation. The k-factorfor Wγ∗/WZ(∗)with mℓℓ>7 GeV is 1.5±0.5. These un- certainties aﬀect mostly the 1-jet channel, where their impact on the total background yield is approximately 4%.

Instead, the 0-jet (1-jet) signal re- gions are subdivided into ﬁve (three) mTbins. For the 2-jet signal region, only the results integrated over mT are used, due to the small number of events in the ﬁnal sample. The statistical interpretation of the observed excessofeventsispresentedinSection9. 7. Statistical procedure The statistical procedure used to interpret the data is described in Refs. [17,
118–121]. The parameter of in- terest is the global signal strength factor µ, which acts as a scale factor on the total number of events pre- dicted by the Standard Model for the Higgs boson sig- nal. This factor is deﬁned such that µ=0 corresponds to the background-only hypothesis and µ=1 corre- spondsto the SM Higgs boson signal in addition to the background. Hypothesisedvaluesof µare testedwith a statisticλ(µ) basedontheproﬁlelikelihoodratio[122]. This test statistic extracts the information on the signal strengthfromafulllikelihoodﬁttothedata. Thelikeli- hood function includes all the parameters that describe thesystematicuncertaintiesandtheircorrelations. Exclusion limits are based on the CL sprescrip- tion [123]; a value of µis regarded as excluded at 95% CL when CL sis less than 5%. A SM Higgs bo- sonwithmass mHisconsideredexcludedat 95%conﬁ- dence level (CL) when µ=1 is excluded at that mass. The signiﬁcance of an excess in the data is ﬁrst quan- 15 tiﬁed with the local p0, the probability that the back- ground can produce a ﬂuctuation greater than or equal to the excess observed in data. The equivalent formu- lation in terms of number of standard deviations, Zl, is referred to as the local signiﬁcance. The global prob- ability for the most signiﬁcant excess to be observed anywherein a givensearchregionisestimated with the methoddescribed in Ref. [124]. The ratio of the global tothelocalprobabilities,thetrialsfactorusedtocorrec t forthe”lookelsewhere”e ﬀect,increaseswiththerange of Higgs boson mass hypotheses considered, the mass resolutionsofthechannelsinvolvedinthecombination, andthesigniﬁcanceoftheexcess. The statistical tests are performed in steps of values ofthehypothesisedHiggsbosonmass mH. Theasymp- totic approximation [122] upon which the results are based has been validated with the method described in Ref.[17]. The combination of individual search sub-channels for a speciﬁc Higgs boson decay, and the full combi- nation of all search channels, are based on the global signal strength factor µand on the identiﬁcation of the nuisance parameters that correspond to the cor-
related sources of systematic uncertainty described in Section8. 8. Correlated systematic uncertainties The individual search channels that enter the combi- nationaresummarisedinTable 6. The main uncorrelated systematic uncertainties are described in Sections 4–6 for the H→ZZ(∗)→4ℓ, H→γγand H→WW(∗)→ℓνℓνchannels and in Ref. [17] for the other channels. They include the background normalisations or background model parameters from control regions or sidebands, the Monte Carlo simulation statistical uncertainties and the theoretical uncertainties a ﬀecting the background processes. Themainsourcesofcorrelatedsystematic uncertain- tiesarethefollowing. 1.Integrated luminosity: The uncertainty on the integrated luminosity is considered as fully correlated among channels and amounts to ±3.9% for the 7TeV data [132, 133], except for the H→ZZ(∗)→4ℓand H→γγchannels which were re-analysed; the uncer- taintyis±1.8% [92]forthesechannels. Theuncertainty is±3.6%forthe8TeV data. 2.Electron and photon trigger identiﬁcation: The uncertaintiesinthetriggerandidentiﬁcatione ﬃciencies aretreatedasfullycorrelatedforelectronsandphotons.3.Electron and photon energy scales: The elec- tron and photon energy scales in the H→ZZ(∗)→4ℓ andH→γγchannels are described by ﬁve parameters, which providea detailed account of the sources of sys- tematic uncertainty. They are related to the calibration method, the presampler energy scale in the barrel and end-cap calorimeters, and the material description up- streamofthecalorimeters. 4.Muon reconstruction: The uncertainties a ﬀecting muonsareseparatedintothoserelatedtotheIDandMS, in order to obtain a better description of the correlated eﬀectsamongchannelsusingdi ﬀerentmuonidentiﬁca- tioncriteriaanddiﬀerentrangesofmuon pT. 5.Jet energy scale and missing transverse energy: The jet energy scale and jet energy resolution are af- fected by uncertainties which depend on the pT,η, and ﬂavourof the jet. A simpliﬁedscheme isused in which independentJESandJERnuisanceparametersareasso- ciated with ﬁnal states with signiﬁcantly di ﬀerentkine- matic selections and sensitivity to scattering processes with diﬀerent kinematic distributions or ﬂavour com- position. This scheme includes a speciﬁc treatment forb-jets. The sensitivity of the results to various as- sumptions about the correlation between these sources of uncertainty has been found to be negligible. An un- correlated component of the uncertainty on Emiss Tis in-
cluded, in additionto the JES uncertainty,which is due to low energy jet activity not associated with recon- structedphysicsobjects. 6.Theory uncertainties: Correlated theoretical un- certainties aﬀect mostly the signal predictions. The QCD scale uncertainties for mH=125 GeV amount to +7% −8%fortheggFprocess, ±1%fortheVBF and WH/ZH processes, and+4% −9%for the t¯tHprocess [52, 53]; the small dependenceof these uncertaintieson mHis taken intoaccount. Theuncertaintiesonthepredictedbranch- ing ratios amount to ±5%. The uncertainties related to thepartondistributionfunctionsamountto ±8%forthe predominantly gluon-initiated ggF and t¯tHprocesses, and±4% for the predominantly quark-initiated VBF andWH/ZHprocesses [78, 134–136]. The theoretical uncertainty associated with the exclusive Higgs boson production process with additional jets in the H→γγ, H→WW(∗)→ℓνℓνandH→τ+τ−channelsisestimated using the prescription of Refs. [53, 117, 118], with the noticeable diﬀerence that an explicit calculation of the gluon-fusion process at NLO using MCFM [137] in the 2-jet category reduces the uncertainty on this non-negligible contribution to 25%. An additional theoretical uncertainty on the signal normalisation of ±150%×(mH/TeV)3(e.g.±4% for mH=300 GeV) ac- counts for eﬀects related to oﬀ-shell Higgs boson pro- 16 Table6: Summaryoftheindividualchannelsenteringthecom bination.

Resultsareshownseparately forthe√s=7TeVdata(dark,blue),the√s=8TeV data (light, red), and their combination (black). The largest local signiﬁcance for the combination of the 7 and 8 TeV data is found for a SM Higgs boson mass hypothesis of mH=126.5GeV, where it reaches 6.0σ, with an expected value in the presence of a SM Higgs boson signal at that mass of 4 .9σ(see also Ta- ble 7). For the 2012 data alone, the maximum lo- cal signiﬁcance for the H→ZZ(∗)→4ℓ,H→γγand H→WW(∗)→eνµνchannelscombinedis4.9 σ,andoc- cursat mH=126.5GeV (3.8σexpected). The signiﬁcance of the excess is mildly sensitive to uncertaintiesin the energyresolutionsand energyscale systematic uncertainties for photons and electrons; the eﬀect of the muon energy scale systematic uncertain- ties is negligible. The presence of these uncertainties, evaluated as described in Ref. [138], reduces the local signiﬁcanceto 5.9 σ.

Characterising the excess The mass of the observed new particle is esti- mated using the proﬁle likelihood ratio λ(mH) for H→ZZ(∗)→4ℓandH→γγ, the two channels with the highest mass resolution. The signal strength is al- lowed to vary independently in the two channels, al- though the result is essentially unchanged when re- stricted to the SM hypothesis µ=1. The leading sources of systematic uncertainty come from the elec- tron and photon energy scales and resolutions. The re- sulting estimate for the mass of the observedparticle is 126.0±0.4 (stat)±0.4 (sys)GeV. The best-ﬁt signal strength ˆ µis shownin Fig. 7(c) as a function of mH. The observed excess corresponds to ˆµ=1.4±0.3 for mH=126GeV, which is consistent with the SM Higgs boson hypothesis µ=1. A sum- mary of the individual and combined best-ﬁt values of the strength parameter for a SM Higgs boson mass hy- pothesis of 126GeV is shown in Fig. 10, while more information about the three main channels is provided inTable7. In order to test which values of the strength and mass of a signal hypothesis are simultaneously consis- tentwiththedata,theproﬁlelikelihoodratio λ(µ,mH)is used.

Conclusion Searches for the Standard Model Higgs boson have been performed in the H→ZZ(∗)→4ℓ,H→γγand H→WW(∗)→eνµνchannels with the ATLAS experi- mentattheLHCusing5.8–5.9fb−1ofppcollisiondata recordedduring April to June 2012 at a centre-of-mass energy of 8TeV. These results are combined with ear- lier results [17], which are based on an integrated lu- minosity of 4.6–4.8 fb−1recorded in 2011 at a centre- of-mass energy of 7TeV, except for the H→ZZ(∗)→4ℓ andH→γγchannels,whichhavebeenupdatedwiththe improvedanalysespresentedhere. The Standard Model Higgs boson is excluded at 95% CL in the mass range 111–559GeV, except for the narrow region 122–131GeV. In this region, an ex- cess of events with signiﬁcance 5 .9σ, corresponding top0=1.7×10−9, is observed.

Taking into account the entire mass range of the search, 110– 600GeV, the global signiﬁcance of the excess is 5 .1σ, whichcorrespondsto p0=1.7×10−7. These results provide conclusive evidence for the discovery of a new particle with mass 126.0±0.4 (stat)±0.4 (sys)GeV. The signal strength parameter µhas the value 1 .4±0.3 at the ﬁtted mass, which is consistent with the SM Higgs boson hypothesis µ=1. The decays to pairs of vector bosons whose net electric charge is zero identify the new particle as a neutral boson. The observation in the diphoton channel disfavours the spin-1 hypothe- sis [140, 141]. Although these results are compatible withthehypothesisthatthenewparticleistheStandard Model Higgs boson, more data are needed to assess its naturein detail.
