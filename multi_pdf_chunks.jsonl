Theabsoluteenergyscaleissetusing a large sample of \ud835\udc4d-boson decays into electron\u2013positron pairs, and its residual dependence on the electron energy is used for the first time to further constrain systematic uncertainties. The achieved calibration uncertainties are typically 0.05% for electrons from resonant \ud835\udc4d-boson decays, 0.4% at \ud835\udc38T\u223c10GeV, and 0.3% at \ud835\udc38T\u223c1TeV; for photons at \ud835\udc38T\u223c60GeV, they are 0.2% on average. This is more than twice as precise as the previous calibration.

Optimalenergyreconstructionandcalibrationoftheelectromagneticcalorimeterisnecessary forallanalysesinvolvingelectronsandphotons,andespeciallyforprecisemeasurementsofthemassesand properties of the Higgs, \ud835\udc4aand\ud835\udc4dbosons. The present paper describes the calorimeter energy calibration using the Run 2 data sample. Thecalibrationschemecomprisesseveralsteps: asimulation-basedoptimizationoftheenergymeasurement for electrons and photons, corrections for observed differences between data and simulation, calibration of the layers of the calorimeter and a final adjustment of the global energy scale using the abundant sample of electron\u2013positron pairs from \ud835\udc4d-boson decays. The resulting calibration corrections are validated using electrons from \ud835\udc3d/\ud835\udf13decays and photons from radiative \ud835\udc4d-boson decays.

The optimization is performed separately for electrons, converted photons and unconverted photons, taking into account the particle position. It is the same as the one used in Ref. [3] and the methodology is discussed in detail in Ref. [2]. SincetheEMcalorimeterissegmentedindepth,thelongitudinallayersshouldbecalibratedseparately to provide a correct description of the calorimeter response as a function of \ud835\udc38T(step 1). After these corrections, the simulation-based calibration is applied identically to the cluster energies reconstructed from collision data and simulated event samples (step 2). A set of additional corrections is applied to data to account for response variations not included in the simulation in specific detector regions, e.g. regions with non-optimal high voltage, azimuthal non- uniformities, orbiasesassociated withthe liquid-argoncalorimeter\u2019selectronics calibration(step 3). The stability of the calorimeter response as a function of azimuth, time and pile-up is also studied. A final adjustment of the calorimeter response is derived from samples of \ud835\udc4d\u2192\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52events, so that the peak ofthe\ud835\udc4dresonancereconstructedindatacoincideswiththatinthesimulation.

The effect of this correction is illustrated in Figure 4.

This correction was computed from 2015+2016 data and applied to the full Run 2 sample. The observed non-zero residuals have no impact on the final result reflects data taken in 2017, and the discrepancies observed in this region justify the extraction of dedicated energy-scale corrections for each data-taking year. More details are given in Section 7. The stability of the response as a function of the number of reconstructed collision vertices ( \ud835\udc41vtx) [34] is shown in Figure 5(c). Classifying events according to \ud835\udc41vtx, related to the number of interactions in the specific bunch crossing, biases the pile-up activity of colliding bunches relative to the average. In this case the compensation of the pile-up contributions to the reconstructed energy by the bipolar shaping becomes imperfect, giving rise to the observed slope.

In practice, the energy response of each cell is determined during dedicated electronics calibration runs, parameterizing the relation between theinjectedcurrentandthemeasuredADCcountusingalinearfunction. Thefitstothecalibrationdata show non-zero residuals, caused by intrinsic non-linear behaviour of the electronics. This is illustrated in Figure 6 for an example cell and a calibration run performed in medium gain (MG). The residuals deviate from a linear fit by about 0.3%; comparable deviations are observed in high-gain (HG) calibration runs. Theimplicationsofthisnon-linearityaretwofold.

In each channel, the statistical correlation between the two methods is ignored, as systematic uncertainties dominate; the latter are found to be largely uncorrelated as a function of |\ud835\udf02|. First, the muon 19 and electron measurements are combined separately. The results are shown asthe blue and red open dots in Figure 14(a). The uncertainty in the combined muon measurement includes the systematic uncertainty induced by the extrapolation of this calibration to electron and photon showers [1]. This uncertainty accounts for the uncertainties in the simulation of the ionization current induced by muons, and how these uncertainties affect EM showers.

The combined effect of these variations is a systematic uncertainty of about 0.05% in\ud835\udefcclosure \ud835\udc56over most of the calorimeter acceptance, but reaching 0.5% in the transition regions between the barrel and endcap calorimeters and at the edge of the calorimeter ( |\ud835\udf02|>2.3). The systematic uncertainty in the \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56corrections ranges between 0.1% and 0.2% across the detector acceptance. The dominant contribution to the systematic uncertainty comes from the mass window variation.

Forconvertedphotons,itbecomes0.69%\u20131.31%inthebarrel and 0.01%\u20130.1% in the endcaps.

Discrepancies between leakage modelling and data were observed in previous publications [1, 2], and the full sizeof thediscrepancies was consideredas a systematicuncertainty inthe photon energycalibration. The statistical power of the Run 2 data allows an improved mapping of the |\ud835\udf02|and\ud835\udc38Tdependence of this effect, and a correction is derived. The systematic variations, defined as above, reduce the residual uncertainty and allow a decrease in the corresponding calibration uncertainty by a factor of about two. 9 Electron and photon energy scale uncertainties The complete systematic uncertainty model contains 64 and 67 independent uncertainty variations"}

The presentanalysisconsidersseparatesourcesofuncertaintyforthetransitionsbetweenHighandMedium gain,andbetweenMediumandLowgaininLayer2. Inthepreviousanalyses,asingleuncertaintywas 25 used to cover both gain transitions. In addition, because of the improved strategy for the \ud835\udefc12measurement (now also using an electron sample), the size of the uncertainty associated with the transition between High and Medium gain in Layer 1 was re-estimated for the current analysis. The corresponding sources of uncertainty are considered fully correlated in pseudorapidity. Thepresamplercalibrationandtheintercalibrationofthefirstandsecondaccordionlayersareestimated in nine and seven|\ud835\udf02|regions, respectively, with corresponding sources of uncertainty. Uncertainties corresponding to the \ud835\udc4dscale calibration, photon reconstruction and classification, pile-up modelling, and lateral shower shape development are all fully correlated in pseudorapidity. For the last category, an exception is the energy scale dependence on the shower width in \ud835\udf02, where the region 1.52<|\ud835\udf02|<1.82is considered to be independent of the rest of the pseudorapidity interval.

The corresponding leading-order Feynman diagrams for the signal and background processes are shown in Figures 1 and 2. Owing to the clean signature and accessible branching fractions, the four-lepton final states ( 4\u2113and2\u21132\ud835\udf08with\u2113=\ud835\udc52or\ud835\udf07), originating from the decays of a pair of on-shell \ud835\udc4dbosons induced by a virtual Higgs boson, offer the main signal sensitivity.

Control regions (CRs) are defined to ensure control of the background modelling. In both channels, the background from the combination of vector-boson associated production to a top-quark pair ( \ud835\udc61\u00af\ud835\udc61+V, V=W or Z) and triboson production (ZZZ, WZZ, or WWZ) is at thepercentlevel.

[32]. The inner tracking detector (ID), covering the region |\ud835\udf02|<2.5, consists of a silicon pixel detector, a silicon microstrip detector, and a transition-radiation tracker. The innermost layer of the pixel detector, the insertable B-layer [33], was installedbetweenRun1andRun2oftheLHC.Theinnerdetectorissurroundedbyathinsuperconducting solenoidprovidinga 2Tmagneticfield,andbyafinelysegmentedlead/liquid-argon(LAr)electromagnetic calorimetercoveringtheregion |\ud835\udf02|<3.2. Asteel/scintillator-tilehadroncalorimeterprovidescoverage in the central region |\ud835\udf02|<1.7. The endcap and forward regions, covering the pseudorapidity range 1.5 <|\ud835\udf02|<4.9, are instrumented with LAr electromagnetic and hadron calorimeters, with steel, copper, or tungsten as the absorber material. A muon spectrometer (MS) system incorporating large superconducting toroidal air-core magnets surrounds the calorimeters. Three layers of precision wire chambers provide muon tracking in the range of |\ud835\udf02|<2.7, while dedicated fast chambers are used for triggering in the region|\ud835\udf02|<2.4. Thetrigger system,composedoftwostages,was upgraded[34]beforeRun 2. Thefirst stage,implementedwithcustomhardware,usesinformationfromthecalorimetersandmuonchambers to select events from the 40 MHz bunch crossings at a maximum rate of 100 kHz.

To mitigate the impact of pile-up jets in the forward region, another tagger, based on jet shapes and topological jet correlations[72],isusedtosuppressjetsoriginatingfromthepile-upwith \ud835\udc5dT<50GeVand2.5<|\ud835\udf02|<4.5. In addition,\ud835\udc4f-jets are identified using a multivariate \ud835\udc4f-tagging algorithm [73] and events containing them are rejected. The chosen \ud835\udc4f-tagging algorithm has an efficiency of 85% for \ud835\udc4f-jets and a rejection factor of 33 against light-flavour jets, measured in \ud835\udc61\u00af\ud835\udc61events [74].

In each quadruplet, the lepton pair with mass closest to the \ud835\udc4dboson mass, \ud835\udc5a12, is referred to as the leading pair and required to have 50< \ud835\udc5a 12<106GeV.

It has a larger branching fraction than the 4\u2113channel, but is subject to larger background contamination. Candidate events are preselected by requiring exactly two electrons or muons with opposite charges and \ud835\udc5dT>20GeV. The leading lepton must have \ud835\udc5dT>30GeVto surpass the trigger thresholds. To suppress the \ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4dbackground, events containing any additional lepton satisfying the loose identification criteria with \ud835\udc5dT>7GeVare rejected. Requiring the dilepton invariant mass ( \ud835\udc5a\u2113\u2113) to be between 76 and 106 GeVlargely reduces the contamination from the non-resonant- \u2113\u2113background, originating from \ud835\udc61\u00af\ud835\udc61, single-top (dominated by the\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc61process), and \ud835\udc5e\u00af\ud835\udc5e\u2192\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4aproduction. Events that satisfy this preselection are then further separatedintotheSRsandCRs.

Candidate events are required to have \ud835\udc38miss T>120GeVandS(\ud835\udc38miss T)>10. The azimuthal-angle difference between the dilepton system and \u00ae\ud835\udc38miss T,\u0394\ud835\udf19(\u00ae\ud835\udc5d\u2113\u2113 T,\u00ae\ud835\udc38miss T), must be larger than 2.5 radians, and the selected leptons must be close to each other, with the distance \u0394\ud835\udc45\u2113\u2113below 1.8. Furthermore, the azimuthal-angledifferencebetweenanyoftheselectedjetswith \ud835\udc5dT>100GeVand\u00ae\ud835\udc38miss Tmustbelarger than 0.4 radians to suppress events with poorly measured jet energies.

The largest source of systematic uncertainties arises from the theoretical modelling of the signal and backgroundprocesses,includingthoserelatedtotheproductionofjetsassociatedwiththeHiggsboson. Experimentaluncertaintiesrelatedtothereconstructionofjetsarealsoprominentwhileotherexperimental uncertainties are generally small. To help understand the impact of the leading uncertainties, their relative size before the statistical fit for a specific process is provided in this section, with the largest uncertainties for the main processes in the signal and control regions summarized in Table 1. The impact of these uncertainties on the observed upper limits of \ud835\udf07off-shellis given in Section 8. ThetheoreticaluncertaintiesarisefromthechoiceofPDF,fromthemissinghigher-ordercorrectionsin both QCD and EW perturbative calculations, and from the modelling of the parton shower. ThePDFuncertaintiesareevaluatedusingtheNNPDFprescriptionwithMCreplicas. ThePDFcovariance matrix between each channel of the analysis is estimated from the 100 replicas from the NNPDF3.0 NNLO set. Only the principal component of the covariance matrix has a non-negligible impact on the yields and it is usedas a representation of the PDF uncertainty includingits bin-by-bin correlations. The uncertaintiesduetomissinghigher-orderQCDcorrectionsareestimatedbyvaryingtherenormalisation and factorisation scales independently, ranging from a factor of one-half to two (excluding the cases in which one scale is varied down by one-half and the other up by two). For the \ud835\udc5e\u00af\ud835\udc5e\u2192\ud835\udc4d\ud835\udc4dbackground, the uncertainty is evaluated independently in bins of \ud835\udc41jets. For the gluon-induced processes, including"}

In both channels, the same uncertainty in the gluon\u2013gluon processes ranges from 10% to 20%. The uncertainties due to missing higher-order EW corrections (HOEW) are considered for the main \ud835\udc5e\u00af\ud835\udc5e\u2192\ud835\udc4d\ud835\udc4dbackground and handled differently in the two channels. For the 2\u21132\ud835\udf08channel, the difference in the NLO EW correction between the multiplicative and additive methods as a function of \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4d\ud835\udc4dis assigned astheuncertainty[57]. Thisuncertaintyrangesfrom1%toatmost20%ofthecross-sectiondepending onthebinsofobservables. Forthe 4\u2113channel,theNLOEWcorrectionsarecalculatedontopoftheLO QCD cross-section. Therefore, a specific prescription [82], also applied in Ref. [27], is used to derive theuncertaintytoaccountformissingNLOQCD+EWdiagrams. Astudyofthecompatibilitybetween the two methods inthe 4\u2113channel shows thatthe central values agreeto within afewpercent while the uncertainties have a similar size. The uncertainties due to the modelling of the parton shower and hadronisation play an important role in this search, as jet multiplicity, a key variable used todefine both the SRsand the CRs, is particularly sensitivetothemodellingofmatrixelements,partonshowering,andthemergingandmatchingbetween the two. The parton shower (PS) uncertainties are evaluated by varying resummation and matching scales 14 for the processes simulated with the Sherpagenerator. These variations for Sherpasamples are expected to further account for the shape uncertainties relating to missing high-order QCD effects beyond those from the usual QCD scale variations, i.e. migrations between jet bins. For those processes simulated with thePythiashower program, the uncertainty is assessed by varying the Pythiaconfigurations, such as theparametervaluesoftheA14tune,themulti-partonmodelsandthefinal-stateradiationmodels. For ggF production, the PS uncertainties are correlated between the signal and background processes. The uncertainties are split into shape and normalization components, with the latter being more significant. In the"}

A binned likelihood function is constructed as a product of Poisson probability terms over all bins in all the SRs and CRs considered in the analysis, as introduced in Sections 5 and 6. The likelihood depends on the parameters of interest and a set of nuisance parameters \ud835\udf03 that include the effects of systematic uncertainties and statistical uncertainties from the limited number of simulated events. They are constrained using Gaussian and Poisson terms, respectively. Different parameters of interest are used depending on the interpretation. The first interpretation explores two signal strength parameters ( \ud835\udf07ggF off-shell=\ud835\udf052 \ud835\udc54, off-shell\ud835\udf052 \ud835\udc49, off-shelland\ud835\udf07EW off-shell=\ud835\udf054 \ud835\udc49, off-shell) corresponding to the ggF- and EW-induced off-shell contributions, respectively. Here, \ud835\udf05\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udf05\ud835\udc49) refers to the Higgs boson coupling to gluons (vector bosons) normalised to the SM prediction. In the second interpretation, a single off-shell signal-strength parameter ( \ud835\udf07off-shell) is applied for all production modes, assuming that \ud835\udf07ggF off-shell=\ud835\udf07EW off-shell=\ud835\udf07off-shell.

The expected curve is flatter than the observed due to the effect of a downward fluctuation in the data and the parabolic shape of the yield versus \ud835\udf07curve, which arises due to the\u221a\ud835\udf07dependence of the interference. In particular, for electroweak production, the expected yield is minimized at the value of \ud835\udf07=0.8, close to the value\ud835\udf07=1at which the expected \u22122 ln\ud835\udf06curve is minimized.

The results of statistically independent searches for Higgs bosons produced in conjunction with a top quark-antiquark pair and decaying to pairs of W bosons, Z bosons, photons, tleptons, or bottom quark jets are com- bined to maximize sensitivity. An excess of events is observed, with a signi\ufb01cance of 5.2 standard deviations, over the expectation from the background-only hypothesis. The corresponding expected signi\ufb01cance from the standard model for a Higgs boson mass of 125.09 GeV is 4.2 standard deviations.

In particular, the 13 TeV data collected so far by the ATLAS [4] and CMS [5] experiments have led to improved constraints on the couplings of the Higgs boson compared to those performed at the lower energies [6], permitting more precise consistency checks with the predictions of the standard model (SM) of particle physics [7\u20139]. Nonetheless, not all properties of the Higgs boson have been established, in part because"}
{"source": "1804.02610v2.pdf", "text": "of insuf\ufb01ciently large data sets. The lack of statis- tical precision can be partially overcome by combining the results of searches in different decay channels of the Higgs boson and at different CM energies. Among the properties that are not yet well established is the tree-level coupling of Higgs bosons to top quarks. In this Letter, we present a combination of searches for the Higgs boson (H) produced in as- sociation with a top quark-antiquark pair (t t), based on data collected with the CMS detector. Results from data collected atps=13 TeV [10\u201314] are combined with analogous results fromps=7 and 8 TeV [15]. As a result of this combination, we establish the observation of t tH production. This constitutes the \ufb01rst con\ufb01rmation of the tree-level coupling of the Higgs boson to top quarks. A top quark decays almost exclusively to a bottom quark and a W boson, with the W boson subsequently decaying either to a quark and an antiquark or to a charged lepton and its asso- ciated neutrino. The Higgs boson exhibits a rich spectrum of decay modes that includes the decay to a bottom quark-antiquark pair, a t+t\u0000lepton pair, a photon pair, and combinations of quarks and leptons from the decay of intermediate on- or off-shell W and Z bosons. Thus, ttH production gives rise to a wide variety of \ufb01nal-state event topologies, which we consider in our analyses and in the combination of results presented below. In the SM, the masses of elementary fermions are accounted for by introducing a minimal set of Yukawa interactions, compatible with gauge invariance, between the Higgs and fermion \ufb01elds. Following the spontaneous breaking of electroweak symmetry [16\u201321], charged fermions of \ufb02avor f couple to H with a strength yfproportional to the mass mfof those fermions, namely yf=mf/v, where v\u0019246 GeV"}

Measure- ments of the Higgs boson decay rates to down-type fermions ( tleptons and bottom quarks) agree with the SM predictions within their uncertainties [22, 23]. However, the top quark Yukawa coupling ( yt) cannot be similarly tested from the measurement of a decay rate since on-shell top quarks are too heavy to be produced in Higgs boson decay. Instead, constraints onytcan be obtained through the measurement of the pp !ttH production process. Exam- ple tree-level Feynman diagrams for this process are shown in Fig. 1. To date t tH production has eluded de\ufb01nite observation, although \ufb01rst evidence has been recently reported by the AT- LAS [24] and CMS [10] Collaborations. The overall agreement observed between the SM predictions and data for the rate of Higgs boson production through gluon-gluon fusion and for the H !ggdecay mode [6] suggests that the Higgs boson coupling to top quarks is SM-like, since the quantum loops in these pro- cesses include top quarks. However, non-SM particles in the loops could introduce terms that compensate for, and thus mask, other deviations from the SM. A measurement of the produc- tion rate of the tree-level t tH process can provide evidence for, or against, such new-physics contributions. The central feature of the CMS apparatus is a superconducting solenoid of 6 m internal diame- ter, providing a magnetic \ufb01eld of 3.8 T.

Muons are detected in gas-ionization chambers embedded in the steel \ufb02ux-return yoke outside the solenoid. A detailed description of the CMS detector can be found in Ref. [5]. Events of interest are selected using a two-tiered trigger system [25] based on custom hardware processors and a farm of commercial processors running a version of the full reconstruction software optimized for speed. Of\ufb02ine, a particle-\ufb02ow algorithm [26] is used to reconstruct and identify each particle in an event based on a combination of information from the various CMS subdetectors. Additional identi\ufb01cation criteria are employed to improve purities and de\ufb01ne the \ufb01nal samples of candidate electrons, muons, hadronically decaying tleptons ( th) [27, 28], and photons. Jets are reconstructed from particle-\ufb02ow candidates using the anti- kTclustering algorithm [29] implemented in the F ASTJETpackage [30]. Multivariate algorithms [31, 32] are used to identify (tag) jets arising from the hadronization of bottom quarks (b jets) and discrim- inate against gluon and light \ufb02avor quark jets. The algorithms utilize observables related to the long lifetimes of hadrons containing b quarks and the relatively larger particle multiplicity and mass of b jets compared to light \ufb02avor quark jets. The thidenti\ufb01cation is based on the reconstruction of the hadronic tdecay modes t\u0000!h\u0000nt, h\u0000p0nt, h\u0000p0p0nt, and h\u0000h+h\u0000nt (plus the charge conjugate reactions), where h\u0006denotes either a charged pion or kaon. More details about the reconstruction procedures are given in Refs. [10\u201315].

The 13 TeV analyses are improved relative to the 7 and 8 TeV studies in that they employ triggers with higher ef\ufb01ciencies, contain improvements in the reconstruction and background-rejection methods, and use more precise theory calculations to describe the signal and the background processes. For the 7, 8 and 13 TeV data, the theoretical calculations of Ref. [35] for Higgs boson production cross sections and branching fractions are used to normalize the expected signal yields. The event samples are divided into exclusive categories depending on the multiplicity and kinematic properties of reconstructed electrons, muons, thcandidates, photons, jets, and tagged b jets in an event. Samples of simulated events based on Monte Carlo event generators, with simulation of the detector response based on the G EANT 4 [36] suite of programs, are used to evaluate the detector acceptance and optimize the event selection for each category. In the anal- ysis of data, the background is, in general, evaluated from data control regions. When this is not feasible, either because the background process has a very small cross section or a control region depleted of signal events cannot be identi\ufb01ed, the background is evaluated from sim- ulation with a systematic uncertainty assigned to account for the known model dependence.

A search for t tH production in the H !ggdecay mode is performed in events with two reconstructed photons in combination with reconstructed electrons or muons, jets, and tagged b jets [13]. The signal yield is extracted from a \ufb01t to the diphoton invariant mass spectrum. Events with combinations of jets and tagged b jets and with two same-sign leptons, three leptons, or four leptons are used to search for t tH production in the H !t+t\u0000, WW\u0003, or ZZ\u0003decay modes [10, 14], where in this case \u201clepton\u201d refers to an electron, muon, or thcandidate (the asterisk denotes an off-shell particle). The searches in the different decay channels are statistically independent from each other. Analogous searches have been performed with the 7 and 8 TeV data [15].

The two hatched histograms, each stacked on top of the background histogram, show the signal expectation for the SM ( mttH=1) and the observed ( mttH=1.26) signal strengths. The lower panel shows the ratios of the expected signal and observed results relative to the expected background. The principal sources of experimental systematic uncertainty in the overall result for mttHstem from the uncertainty in the lepton and b jet identi\ufb01cation ef\ufb01ciencies and in the thand jet energy scales. The background theory systematic uncertainty is dominated by modeling uncertainties in tt production in association with a W boson, a Z boson, or a pair of b or c quark jets. The dominant contribution to the signal theory systematic uncertainty arises from the \ufb01nite accu- racy in the SM prediction for the t tH cross section because of missing higher order terms and uncertainties in the proton parton density functions [35]. To highlight the excess of data over the expectation from the background-only hypothesis, we classify each event that enters the combined \ufb01t by the ratio S/B, where Sand Bare the expected post-\ufb01t signal (with mttH=1) and background yields, respectively, in each bin of the distributions considered in the combination.

In summary, we have reported the observation of t tH production with a signi\ufb01cance of 5.2 stan- dard deviations above the background-only hypothesis, at a Higgs boson mass of 125.09 GeV. The measured production rate is consistent with the standard model prediction within one standard deviation. In addition to comprising the \ufb01rst observation of a new Higgs boson pro- duction mechanism, this measurement establishes the tree-level coupling of the Higgs boson to the top quark, and hence to an up-type quark.

The detector operates at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. It was conceived to study proton-proton (and lead- lead) collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 14 TeV (5.5 TeV nucleon-nucleon) and at luminosi- ties up to 1034cm\u00002s\u00001(1027cm\u00002s\u00001). At the core of the CMS detector sits a high-magnetic- \ufb01eld and large-bore superconducting solenoid surrounding an all-silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead-tungstate scintillating-crystals electromagnetic calorimeter, and a brass-scintillator sampling hadron calorimeter. The iron yoke of the \ufb02ux-return is instrumented with four stations of muon detectors covering most of the 4p solid angle. Forward sampling calorimeters extend the pseudo- rapidity coverage to high values (j hj\u00145) assuring very good hermeticity. The overall dimensions of the CMS detector are a length of 21.6 m, a diameter of 14.6 m and a total weight of 12500"}

The LHC is presently being constructed in the already existing 27-km LEP tunnel in the Geneva region. It will yield head-on collisions of two pro- ton (ion) beams of 7 TeV (2.75 TeV per nucleon) each, with a design luminosity of 1034cm\u00002s\u00001 (1027cm\u00002s\u00001). This paper provides a description of the design and construction of the CMS detec- tor. CMS is installed about 100 metres"}

The prime motivation of the LHC is to elucidate the nature of electroweak symmetry break- ing for which the Higgs mechanism is presumed to be responsible. The experimental study of the Higgs mechanism can also shed light on the mathematical consistency of the Standard Model at energy scales above about 1 TeV . Various alternatives to the Standard Model invoke new symme- tries, new forces or constituents. Furthermore, there are high hopes for discoveries that could pave the way toward a uni\ufb01ed theory. These discoveries could take the form of supersymmetry or extra dimensions, the latter often requiring modi\ufb01cation of gravity at the TeV scale. Hence there are many compelling reasons to investigate the TeV energy scale. The LHC will also provide high-energy heavy-ion beams at energies over 30 times higher than at the previous accelerators, allowing us to further extend the study of QCD matter under extreme conditions of temperature, density, and parton momentum fraction (low-x ). Hadron colliders are well suited to the task of exploring new energy domains, and the region of 1 TeV constituent centre-of-mass energy can be explored if the proton energy and the luminosity are high enough. The beam energy and the design luminosity of the LHC have been chosen in order to study physics at the TeV energy scale. A wide range of physics is potentially possible with the seven-fold increase in energy and a hundred-fold increase in integrated luminosity over the previous hadron collider experiments. These conditions also require a very careful design of the detectors. The total proton-proton cross-section atps=14 TeV is expected to be roughly 100 mb. At design luminosity the general-purpose detectors will therefore observe an event rate of approxi- mately 109inelastic events/s. This"}
{"source": "The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf", "text": "leads to a number of formidable experimental challenges. The online event selection process (trigger ) must reduce the huge rate to about 100 events/s for storage and subsequent analysis. The short time between bunch crossings, 25 ns, has major implications for the design of the read-out and trigger systems. \u2013 1 \u2013 2008 JINST 3 S08004At the design luminosity, a mean of about 20 inelastic collisions will be superimposed on the event of interest. This implies that around 1000 charged particles will emerge from the interaction region every 25 ns. The products of an interaction under study may be confused with those from other interactions in the same bunch crossing. This problem clearly becomes more severe when the response time of a detector element and its electronic signal is longer than 25 ns. The effect of this pile-up can be reduced by using high-granularity detectors with good time resolution, resulting in low occupancy. This requires a large number of detector channels. The resulting millions of detector electronic channels require very good synchronization. The large \ufb02ux of particles coming from the interaction region leads to high radiation levels, requiring radiation-hard detectors and front-end electronics. The detector requirements for CMS to meet the goals of the LHC physics programme can be summarised as follows: \u2022 Good muon identi\ufb01cation and momentum resolution over a wide range of momenta and angles, good dimuon mass resolution (\u0019 1% at 100 GeV), and the ability to determine un- ambiguously the charge of muons with p<1 TeV; \u2022 Good charged-particle momentum resolution and reconstruction ef\ufb01ciency in the inner tracker. Ef\ufb01cient triggering and of\ufb02ine tagging of t\u2019s and b-jets, requiring pixel detectors close to the interaction region; \u2022 Good electromagnetic energy resolution, good diphoton and dielectron mass resolution (\u0019 1% at 100 GeV), wide geometric coverage, p0rejection, and"}

The design of CMS, detailed in the next section, meets these requirements. The main distin- guishing features of CMS are a high-\ufb01eld solenoid, a full-silicon-based inner tracking system, and a homogeneous scintillating-crystals-based electromagnetic calorimeter. The coordinate system adopted by CMS has the origin centered at the nominal collision point inside the experiment, the y-axis pointing vertically upward, and the x-axis pointing radially inward toward the center of the LHC. Thus, the z-axis points along the beam direction toward the Jura mountains from LHC Point 5. The azimuthal angle fis measured from the x-axis in the x-yplane and the radial coordinate in this plane is denoted by r. The polar angle qis measured from the z- axis. Pseudorapidity is de\ufb01ned as h=\u0000lntan( q=2). Thus, the momentum and energy transverse to the beam direction, denoted by pTandET, respectively, are computed from the xandycomponents. The imbalance of energy measured in the transverse plane is denoted by Emiss T. 1.1 General concept An important aspect driving the detector design and layout is the choice of the magnetic \ufb01eld con\ufb01guration for the measurement of the momentum of muons.

The return \ufb01eld is large enough to saturate 1.5 m of iron, allowing 4 muon stations to be integrated to ensure robustness and full geometric coverage. Each muon station consists of several layers of aluminium drift tubes (DT) in the barrel region and cathode strip chambers (CSC) in the endcap region, complemented by resistive plate chambers (RPC). The bore of the magnet coil is large enough to accommodate the inner tracker and the calorimetry inside. The tracking volume is given by a cylinder of 5.8-m length and 2.6-m di- ameter. In order to deal with high track multiplicities, CMS employs 10 layers of silicon microstrip detectors, which provide the required granularity and precision.

The \ufb02ux is re- turned through a 10 000-t yoke comprising 5 wheels and 2 endcaps, composed of three disks each (\ufb01gure 1.1). The distinctive feature of the 220-t cold mass is the 4-layer winding made from a stabilised reinforced NbTi conductor. The ratio between stored energy and cold mass is high (11.6 KJ/kg), causing a large mechanical deformation (0.15%) during energising, well beyond the values of previous solenoidal detector magnets. The parameters of the CMS magnet are summarised in table 2.1. The magnet was designed to be assembled and tested in a surface hall (SX5), prior to being lowered 90 m below ground to its \ufb01nal position in the experimental cavern. After provi- sional connection to its ancillaries, the CMS Magnet has been fully and successfully tested and commissioned in SX5 during autumn 2006. 2.2 Main features of the magnet components 2.2.1 Superconducting solenoid The superconducting"}

In order to provide the necessary hoop strength, a large fraction of the CMS coil must have a structural function. To limit the shear stress level inside the winding and prevent cracking the insulation, especially at the border de\ufb01ned by the winding and the external mandrel, the structural material cannot be too far from the current-carrying elements (the turns). On the basis of these considerations, the innovative design of the CMS magnet uses a self-supporting conductor, by including in it the structural material. The magnetic hoop stress (130 MPa) is shared between the layers (70%) and the support cylindrical mandrel (30%) rather than being taken by the outer mandrel only, as was the case in the previous generation of thin detector solenoids. A cross section of the cold mass is shown in \ufb01gure 2.4. The construction of a winding using a reinforced conductor required technological develop- ments for both the conductor [11] and the winding. In particular, for the winding many problems had to be faced mainly related to the mandrel construction [12], the winding method [13], and the module-to-module mechanical coupling. The modular concept of the cold mass had to face the problem of the module-to-module mechanical connection.

The easy relative movement of these elements facilitates the assembly of the sub-detectors. To displace each element a combination of heavy-duty air pads plus grease pads has been chosen. This choice makes the system insensitive to metallic dust on the \ufb02oor and allows transverse displacements. Two kinds of heavy-duty high-pressure air pads with a capacity of either 250 t (40 bars) or 385 t (60 bars) are used. This is not favourable for the \ufb01nal approach when closing the detector, especially for the YE1 endcap that is protruding into the vacuum tank.

One of the main components of the protection is the dump resistor, made of three elements. 2.2.3 Electrical scheme The CMS solenoid can be represented as a 14 H inductance mutually coupled with its external mandrel. This inductive coupling allows for the so-called quench back effect, as the eddy currents, induced in the external mandrel at the trigger of a current fast discharge, heat up the whole coil above the superconducting critical temperature. This is the fundamental basis of the protection system, which, in case of a superconducting to resistive transition of the coil, aims at keeping the lowest possible thermal gradients and temperature increase in the superconducting windings, and prevents the occurrence of local overheating, hence reducing the thermal stresses inside the winding. A diagram of the powering circuit with protection is shown in \ufb01gure 2.7. A bipolar thyristor power converter rated at 520 kW with passive L-C \ufb01lters is used to power the CMS solenoid. It covers a range of voltages from +26 V to -23 V , with a nominal DC current of 19.1 kA. In case of a sudden switch off of the power converter, the current decays naturally in the bus-bar resistance and through the free-wheel thyristors until the opening of the main breakers. Inside the power converter, an assembly of free-wheel thyristors, mounted on naturally air-cooled heat sinks, is installed. In case of non-opening of the main switch breakers, the thyristors are rated to support 20 kA DC for 4"}

The current discharge is achieved by disconnecting the electrical power source by the use of two redundant 20 kA DC normally-open switch breakers, leaving the solenoid in series with a resistor, in a L-R circuit con\ufb01guration. The stored magnetic energy is therefore extracted by thermal dissipation in the so-called dump resistor. This resistor is external to the solenoid cryostat and is designed to work without any active device. It is positioned \u2013 12 \u2013 2008 JINST 3 S08004outdoors taking advantage of natural air convection cooling. The fast discharge (FD) is automat- ically triggered by hardwired electronics only in case of a superconductive-to-resistive transition, a so-called quench, and for unrecoverable faults which require fast current dumping. The FD time constant is about 200 s. An emergency FD button is also available to the operator in case of need. As the coil becomes resistive during the FD, energy is dissipated inside the coil, which heats up. As a consequence, this necessitates a post-FD cool-down of the coil. The FD is performed on a 30 mW dump resistor, as a compromise to keep the dump voltage lower than 600 V , and to limit the coil warm-up and subsequent cool-down time. For faults involving the 20 kA power source, a slow discharge (SD) is triggered through hardwired electronics on a 2 mW dump resistor. The SD current evolution is typically exponential, and its time constant is 7025 s, but the coil stays in the superconducting state as the heat load, about 525 W, is fully absorbed by the cooling refrigerator. For current lower than 4 kA, a FD is performed in any case, as the heat load is small enough for the refrigerator.

It consists of 2 double-primary pumping stations, equipped with 2 rotary pumps and 2 Root\u2019s pumps, that provide the fore vacuum to the two oil diffusion pumps located at the top of CMS and connected to the coil cryostat via the current leads chimney and the helium phase separator. The rotary pumps have a capacity of 280 m3/h while the two Root\u2019s pumps have a \ufb02ow of 1000 m3/h. The biggest oil diffusion pump, installed via a DN 400 \ufb02ange on the current leads chimney, has a nominal \ufb02ow of 8000 l/s at 10\u00004mbar of fore vacuum. The smallest one delivers 3000 l/s at the phase separator. 2.2.5 Cryogenic plant The helium refrigeration plant for CMS is speci\ufb01ed for a cooling capacity of 800 W at 4.45 K, 4500 W between 60 and 80 K, and simultaneously 4 g/s liquefaction capacity. The primary compressors of the plant have been installed, in their \ufb01nal position, while the cold box, as well as the intermedi- ate cryostat which interfaces the phase separator and the thermo-syphon, were moved underground after the completion of the magnet test. These components were commissioned with the help of a temporary heat load of 6.5 kW that simulated the coil cryostat which was not yet available.

The quench detection system is a key element of the Magnet Safety System (MSS). The role of the quench detection system is to detect a resistive voltage be- tween two points of the coil, whose value and duration are compared to adjustable thresholds. The voltage taps are protected by 4.7 kW, 6 W resistors. There are 2 redundant systems, with resistor bridge detectors and differential detectors. For each system, there are 5 detectors. Each resistor bridge detector spans two modules and one detector spans the whole solenoid.

Figure 2.9shows the cool-down curve. The only glitch was due to an overpressure on a safety release valve that stopped cooling for one night before the system was restarted. One important aspect monitored during the cool-down was the amount of coil shrinkage. In order to explain this point, we refer to the coil suspension system inside the cryostat (\ufb01gure 2.1), made of longitudinal, vertical, and axial tie-rods in Ti alloy.

To measure the tension and \ufb02exion strain, 3 strain gauges are placed on the tie rods at 0\u000e, 90\u000e, and 180\u000e.

Geometrical surveys were performed at each step of the magnet assembly to ensure a good positioning. Nevertheless, the monitoring of the coil magnetic misalignment is of prime importance during magnet power test. The misalignment can be calculated either by analysing the displacement of the cold mass or the stresses of the tie rods when the coil is energised. The displacement is measured at several loca- tions and directions at both ends of the coil with respect to the external vacuum tank wall, by the use of rectilinear potentiometers. Results are displayed in \ufb01gures 2.12 and2.13. The displacement of the coil\u2019s geometric centre is found to be 0.4 mm in z, in the +z direction. According to the computations, such a displacement indicates that the coil"}

The cold mass V on Mises stress versus the coil current is given in \ufb01gure 2.16. The measured value of V on Mises stress at 4.5 K and zero current is 23 MPa. The value at 19.1 kA is 138 MPa.

It surrounds the interaction point and has a length of 5: 8m and a diameter of 2: 5m. The CMS solenoid provides a homogeneous magnetic \ufb01eld of 4 T over the full volume of the tracker. At the LHC design luminosity of 1034cm\u00002s\u00001there will be on average about 1000 particles from more than 20 overlapping proton-proton interactions traversing the tracker for each bunch crossing, i.e. every 25ns. Therefore a detector technology featuring high granularity and fast response is required, such that the trajectories can be identi\ufb01ed reliably and attributed to the correct bunch crossing. However, these features imply a high power density of the on-detector electronics which in turn requires ef\ufb01cient cooling. This is in direct con\ufb02ict with the aim of keeping to the minimum the amount of material in order to limit multiple scattering, bremsstrahlung, photon conversion and nuclear interactions. A compromise had to be found in this respect. The intense particle \ufb02ux will also cause severe radiation damage to the tracking system. The main challenge in the design of the tracking system was to develop detector components able to operate in this harsh environment for an expected lifetime of 10 years. These requirements on granularity, speed and radiation hardness lead to a tracker design entirely based on silicon detector technology. The CMS tracker is composed of a pixel detector with three barrel layers at radii between 4: 4cm and 10: 2cm and a silicon strip tracker with 10 barrel detection layers extending outwards to a radius of 1: 1m.

The construction of the CMS tracker, composed of 1440 pixel and 15 148 strip detector modules, required the development of production methods and quality control procedures that are new to the \ufb01eld of particle physics detectors. A strong collaboration of 51 institutes with almost 500 physicists and engineers succeeded over a period of 12 to 15 years to design, develop and build this unique device. \u2013 26 \u2013 2008 JINST 3 S080043.1.1 Requirements and operating conditions The expected LHC physics program [17] requires a robust, ef\ufb01cient and precise reconstruction of the trajectories of charged particles with transverse momentum above 1GeV in the pseudorapidity rangejhj<2:5. A precise measurement of secondary vertices and impact parameters is necessary for the ef\ufb01cient identi\ufb01cation of heavy \ufb02avours which are produced in many of the interesting physics channels. Together with the electromagnetic calorimeter and the muon system the tracker has to identify electrons and muons, respectively. Tau leptons are a signature in several discovery channels and need to be reconstructed in one-prong and three-prong decay topologies. In order to reduce the event rate from the LHC bunch crossing rate of 40MHz to about 100Hz which can be permanently stored, tracking information is heavily used in the high level trigger of CMS. The operating conditions for a tracking system at the LHC are very challenging. As already mentioned, each LHC bunch crossing at design luminosity creates on average about 1000 particles hitting the tracker. This leads to a"}

At intermediate radii (20cm <r<55cm) the reduced particle \ufb02ux allows the use of silicon micro-strip detectors with a typical cell size of 10cm \u000280mm, leading to an occupancy of up to 2\u20133% per strip and LHC bunch crossing. In the outer region (55cm <r<110cm) the strip pitch can be further increased. Given the large areas that have to be instrumented in this region, also the strip length has to be increased in order to limit the number of read-out channels. However, the strip capacitance scales with its length and therefore the electronics noise is a linear function of the strip length as well. In order to maintain a good signal to noise ratio of well above 10, CMS uses thicker silicon sensors for the outer tracker region (500 mm thickness as opposed to the 320 mm in the inner tracker) with correspondingly higher signal. These thicker sensors would in principle have a higher depletion voltage. But since the radiation levels in the outer tracker are smaller, a higher initial resistivity can be chosen such that the initial depletion voltages of thick and thin sensors are in the same range of 100 V to 300 V .

Three different effects had to be considered in the design of a radiation tolerant silicon tracker. Surface damage is created when the positively charged holes, generated by the passage of an ion- izing particle, get trapped in a silicon oxide layer. This is mostly a concern for the front-end chips where this additional space charge changes for instance the characteristics of MOS structures. Sur- face damage simply scales with the absorbed dose. The silicon sensors are mainly affected by bulk damage, i.e. modi\ufb01cations to the silicon crystal lattice which are caused by non-ionizing energy loss (NIEL) and lead to additional energy levels in the band gap. NIEL is a complicated process, depending on particle type and energy, but is found to scale approximately with the fast hadron \ufb02u- ence. The consequences are an increase of the leakage current (linear in \ufb02uence), a change in the doping from n- to p-type with a corresponding change in depletion voltage by a few hundred volts over the lifetime of the tracker, and the creation of additional trapping centers which will reduce the signal by roughly 10% after 10 years of LHC running [18]. The design of the silicon sensors and the read-out electronics has to take this into account and assure a signal-to-noise ratio of 10:1 or better over the full lifetime of the detector, in order to guarantee a robust hit recognition at an acceptable fake hit rate. Finally, transient phenomena due to the generation of charge by ionizing particles in the electronic circuitry can change for instance the state of memory cells and therefore disturb or even stop the correct functioning of the read-out (single event upset, SEU).

This has to be avoided by ef\ufb01cient coupling of the silicon sensors to the cooling system and by a low operating temperature.

After 10 years of operation it is \u2013 28 \u2013 2008 JINST 3 S08004expected that this will require a cooling \ufb02uid temperature of about \u000027\u00b0C which in turn means that all structures in the tracker have to survive temperature cycles between room temperature and about \u000030\u00b0C. A second effect, called reverse annealing, requires to keep the silicon sensors permanently well below 0\u00b0C except for short maintenance periods. This effect is caused by the interaction of radiation induced defects in the silicon sensors which can lead to more serious damage and to an even stronger change in depletion voltage with \ufb02uence. Experimentally it is found that reverse annealing becomes insigni\ufb01cant for temperatures roughly below 0\u00b0C [18]. The read-out chips employed in the CMS tracker are fabricated in standard 0: 25mm CMOS technology which is inherently radiation hard due to the thin gate oxide (and special design rules). The lifetime of the silicon strip tracker is therefore limited by the radiation damage to the silicon sensors. For ef\ufb01cient charge collection they always need to be over-depleted, requiring bias volt- ages up to 500 V after 10 years of LHC operation.

For the pixel detector on the other hand, which has to survive even higher radiation doses, under-depleted operation is possible due to a different sensor layout. Its lifetime reaches from at least 2 years at full LHC luminosity for the innermost layer to more than 10 years for the third layer. The ultimate position resolution of the pixel and strip sensors is degraded by multiple scatter- ing in the material that is necessary to precisely hold the sensors, to supply the electrical power (in total about 60 kW for the CMS tracker) and to cool the electronics and the silicon sensors. Nuclear interactions of pions and other hadrons in this material reduce signi\ufb01cantly the tracking ef\ufb01ciency for these particles. In addition, this material leads to photon conversion and bremsstrahlung which adversely affect the measurement accuracy of the electromagnetic calorimeter.

The tracker support tube is a large cylinder 5.30 m long with an inner diameter of 2.38 m. The 30-mm-thick wall of the cylinder is made by two 950-1/T300 carbon \ufb01ber composite skins, 2 mm in thickness, sandwiching a 26-mm-high Nomex core. Over the entire length of the tube\u2019s inner surface, two carbon \ufb01ber rails are attached on the horizontal plane. The tracker outer barrel (TOB) and both endcaps (TEC+ and TEC-) rest on these rails by means of adjustable sliding pads. The tracker inner barrel and disks (TIB/TID) are in turn supported by the TOB. The angle between the guiding elements of these rails is controlled to better than 0.183 mrad, corresponding to a parallelism between the guides better than \u00060:5mm in all directions over the full length. An independent support and insertion system for the pixel detectors, the central section of the beam pipe and the inner elements of the radiation monitor system spans the full length of the tracker at its inner radius. This is composed of"}

Two 2420- \u2013 32 \u2013 2008 JINST 3 S08004mm-long side elements are coupled to it only by very precise pinned connections, bridging the gap between the faces of the TIB/TID and the closing \ufb02anges of the tracker without direct contact to the TEC detectors. These side elements are therefore structurally decoupled from the silicon strip detectors and can be installed and removed at any time with no impact on the strip detectors. They serve several purposes: they provide support and alignment features for the central section of the beam pipe, they allow the installation of the inner elements of the radiation monitor system, and they are used for installation and removal of all the components permanently or temporarily housed in the inner region of the tracker: beam pipe, bake-out equipment, pixel barrel, pixel disks and radiation monitor. This system of permanent tracks, light but very stiff and stable, installed in the core of the tracker will allow for the quickest possible intervention in this region during maintenance, inducing no disturbance to the volume occupied by the silicon strip detectors. This feature will be extremely valuable after some years of operation, when activation of components and radiation damage on sensors will start becoming an issue.

The system is feed-back controlled, based on 64 temperature sensors. The total power dissipation inside the tracker volume is expected to be close to 60 kW. Mainly for robustness in operation, the CMS tracker is equipped with a mono-phase liquid cooling system. The liquid used for refrigeration of the silicon strip and pixel detector as well as the thermal screen is C 6F14. It has a suf\ufb01ciently low viscosity even at the lowest required temperature, excellent behaviour under irradiation and is extremely volatile (with practically no residues) thus minimizing eventual damages from accidental leaks. The cooling system provides up to 77m3=hour of C 6F14 liquid to the tracker, at a temperature of down to \u000035\u00b0C and with a pressure drop of up to 8 bar.

This improves the position resolution due to charge sharing and helps to separate signal and noise hits as well as to identify large hit clusters from overlapping tracks. The pixel detector covers a pseudorapidity range \u00002.5< h<2.5, matching the acceptance of the central tracker. The pixel detector is essential for the reconstruction of secondary vertices from b and tau decays, and forming seed tracks for the outer track reconstruction and high level triggering.

For the barrel layers the drift of the electrons to the collecting pixel implant is perpendicular to the 4 T magnetic \ufb01eld of CMS. The resulting Lorentz drift leads to charge spreading of the collected signal charge over more than one pixel. With the analog pulse height being read out a charge interpolation allows \u2013 34 \u2013 2008 JINST 3 S08004to achieve a spatial resolution in the range of 15\u201320 mm. The forward detectors are tilted at 20\u000ein a turbine-like geometry to induce charge-sharing. The charge-sharing is mainly due to the geometric effect of particles entering the detector at an average angle of 20\u000eaway from normal incidence [19]; charge-sharing is also enhanced by the ~E\u0002~Bdrift. A position resolution of approximately 15 mm in both directions can be achieved with charge-sharing between neighbouring pixels. The reduction in the depletion depth or the increase in bias voltage will lead to a reduction of charge-sharing and therefore a degradation of the spatial resolution with radiation damage. In order to allow a replacement of the innermost layers the mechanics and the cabling of the pixel system has been designed to allow a yearly access if needed.

The pixel system is inserted as the last sub-detector of CMS after the silicon strip tracker has been installed and after the central section of the beam pipe has been installed and baked out. 3.2.2 Sensor description Technological choices The sensors for the CMS-pixel detector adopt the so called n-on-n concept. The pixels consist of high dose n-implants introduced into a high resistance n-substrate. The rectifying pn-junction is placed on the back side of the sensor surrounded by a multi guard ring structure. Despite the higher costs due to the double sided processing this concept was chosen as the collection of elec- trons ensures a high signal charge at moderate bias voltages (< 600V) after high hadron \ufb02uences. Furthermore the double sided processing allows a guard ring scheme keeping all sensor edges at ground potential. The isolation technique applied for the regions between the pixel electrodes was developed in close collaboration with the sensor vendors.

The pFEC sends the 40MHz clock and fast control signals (e.g. trigger, reset) to the front end and programs all front end devices. The pxFED receives data from the front end, digitizes it, formats it and sends it to the CMS-DAQ event builder. The pFEC, FEC and pxFED are VME modules located in the electronics room and are connected to the front end through 40 MHz optical links.

This high speed is mandated by the need to rapidly cycle through a refreshing of the pixel threshold trim bits that can become corrupted due to single event upsets. There are four external, write only ports on each Hub for communicating with the ROCs and there is one internal read/write port for communicating with the TBMs within the chip. The \ufb01rst byte of each command will contain a 5-bit Hub address and a 3-bit port address.

After receiving the token back from the last ROC in the chain the TBM sends a trailer containing status information. From the TBM to the end ring of the pixel barrel the read-out uses the module Kapton cable. The Kapton cable has a ground mesh on the back side and the differential analog lines are separated by quiet lines from the fast digital signals. Nevertheless, cross-talk from LVDS signals was found to be unacceptable and a low swing digital protocol is being used instead.

It has 36 optical inputs each equipped with an optical receiver and an ADC. The ADC converts at LHC frequency supplied by the TTC system which can be adjusted by an individually programmed phase shift (16 steps within 25 ns) for precise timing. A programmable offset voltage to compensate bias shifts can also be set. The output of the 10 bit-ADC is processed by a state machine to deliver pixel event fragments consisting of header, trailer, input channel number, ROC numbers, double column numbers and addresses and amplitudes of hit pixels all at a subject-dependent resolution of 5 to 8 bits. Event fragments are strobed into FIFO-1 (1k deep \u000236 bit wide) which can be held on demand to enable read-out via VME.

A histogramming feature has been implemented to monitor the rate of double column hits. This histogram is intended to be read out via VME periodically to check for dead or overloaded columns. The pxFED houses an internal test system which, when enabled, replaces the normal ADC input by a pattern of 256 clocked analog levels simulating a normal pixel event. There are three test DACs (10-bit) available to generate such a pattern meaning that every third input channel receives the same simulated event. This test system allows to test most of the features of the pxFED without the need of external optical input signals.

When transferring pixel trim values to the front end, the pFEC calculates the row number information for a given column of pixels on the \ufb02y. This results in nearly a 50% reduction in the time required to transfer trim values over VME to a given command link buffer. In this way, the entire pixel front end trims can be reloaded in 12 s. Another 2 s are used to load the other con\ufb01guration registers, for a total of 14 s to reload the front end completely. This column mode is also the reason that the return buffer is twice as big as the transmit buffer. The return buffer receives the row number as well as the trim value for each pixel. Once data is loaded into an output buffer, the transfer may be initiated either by computer control, or by a signal from the TTC system. Since single event upsets are expected to occur in the"}

Since updating the front end may disrupt data taking, it is preferable to perform small updates synchronized to orbit gaps or private orbits. This is done through the TTC initiated downloads. For transmission veri\ufb01cation purposes, the number of bytes transmitted is compared to the number of bytes returned from the front end. Also, the returning Hub/port address is compared to the transmitted address.

The two transmitter channels send clock and data back to the FEC from the ring of CCUs. The CCU is the core component developed for the slow control, monitoring and timing distribution in the tracking system [29]. To improve system reliability against a single component failure a redundant interconnection scheme based on doubling signal paths and bypassing of faulty CCUs is implemented. An additional \u201cdummy\u201d CCU node allows to mitigate a single DOH failure preserving complete functionality. A CCU node failure leads to a loss of communication to all electronics attached to that CCU. The \ufb01rst two CCU nodes in the ring provide also the I2C data channels necessary to control the digital optohybrids on the CCU boards. In the BPix each read-out sector is controlled by a separate CCU node. Eight active and one dummy CCU node build a single control ring. One I2C data channel is used to access and control the front end read-out electronics and three output channels generate the necessary signals to reset the digital and the analog optohybrids as well as the read-out chips (ROCs) in one read-out sector. The FPix control ring consists of four active and one dummy CCU node. Each of the active CCU nodes control 3 port cards, which constitute a 45\u000esector in the detector coverage at one end. A connection between a CCU and a port card includes a bi-directional 100 KHz I2C communication channel and two reset signals.

The wafer of populated circuits is then diced into individual circuits using a diamond saw. The circuits are then electrically tested. The hybridized pixel module is attached and wire bonded to a populated VHDI to become a plaquette. The joining is made using parallel plate \ufb01xtures aligned on linear rails. The alignment of components is inspected using a coordinate measuring machine. A \ufb02exible plate is used for \ufb01ne adjustments on the \ufb01xtures resulting in alignments between joined components within 100 mm. The adhesive bond between plaquette components is made in a vacuum at 60\u00b0C, to soften the adhesive and prevent air entrapment. An air cylinder applies and controls the mating pressure, which is limited by the compression allowed on the bump-bonds. The effects of thermal cycling and radiation on the assembled plaquettes have been exten- sively tested. The tests demonstrate that the adhesive and the application method mitigate warping due to temperature changes, and provide reliable strength and thermal conductivity. Once plaquettes are mechanically joined, they are clamped in cassettes that accommodate all processing steps such as wirebonding which provides electrical connections between the ROCs and the VHDI. After wirebonding we encapsulate the feet of wirebonds. This encapsulation is necessary due to periodic I~dl\u0002~Bforces expected to occur during actual CMS operation.

During this test the quality of the plaquettes is evaluated in terms of the characteristics of the sensor, the read-out chip, the number of bad pixels and missing bonds. The assembly and testing rate is optimized for a rate of six plaquettes per day. The completed plaquettes are subjected to a quick plug-in test. Then they are loaded into a Burn-In Box where they undergo 10 temperature cycles between 20\u00b0C and \u000015\u00b0C. These cycles can take up to 2 days to complete, depending upon the thermal load. During these cycles, the plaquettes are monitored for electrical operation. We have seen no failures during the cycling. After the burn-in process is completed, the plaquettes are subjected to a series of electrical tests to ensure their suitability for their eventual mounting on a panel. These tests, at the operating temperature of\u000015\u00b0C, include the functionality of the ROC, the integrity of the bump-bond, and the I-V characteristics of the sensor.

Panel assembly A panel is formed from three or four plaquettes attached to an assembly of a High Density In- terconnect (HDI) laminated to a beryllium plate. The HDI is a three-layer \ufb02exible printed circuit whose trace geometry and characteristics (impedance, low cross-talk) have been optimized for the intended use of transferring digital control and analog output signals. The process by which a panel is assembled is as follows. A single HDI circuit is laminated to a trapezoidal-shaped 0.5 mm thick beryllium plate. Passive components are attached using surface- mount solder techniques. The Token Bit Manager (TBM) is attached to the corner tab of the HDI using a die attach method and wire-bonding. After functional and burn-in tests with only the TBM, the individual plaquettes are attached to the HDI using adhesive for mechanical attachment and wire-bonds for electrical connection. There are four types of panels, a right and left 3-plaquette version, and a right and left 4- plaquette version. The right and left handed versions have their TBMs on opposite sides of the panel centerline. Both types are required so that no panel part projects past a line in the vertical plane.

Full characterization of a plaquette requires hundreds of thousands of measurements. To accomplish this, we have developed special read-out hardware and software that can carry out these measurements quickly and ef\ufb01ciently. A software using a USB-based data acquisition scheme is employed when \ufb02exibility is needed to develop measurement programs of modest complexity and duration, such as the burn-in procedure. For the most extensive measurements, including plaquette testing and characterization, we use a PCI-based system and a software program called Renaissance [31]. Final testing is performed using the real data-acquisition and control hardware and prototype data-acquisition software and constitutes an end-to-end system test. Detailed testing also estab- lishes an initial set of parameters for the many DACs and thresholds in the system. 3.2.6 Power supply All needed high and low DC voltages are generated by means of a commercial modular system of the type CAEN-EASY4000 . This system is also employed by the CMS silicon strip tracker for which the main regulating cards (A4601H) were custom designed [32]. Only small changes in hard- and \ufb01rmware were necessary for adaptation to the pixel project. The core of this system, accessed through LAN, is located in the detector control room (USC55) and consists of one main controller (SY1527) containing 3 branch controllers (A1676A). The actual power supply cards are placed in two racks of 5 crates in close"}

They are fed by local 3-phase 230 V ACto 48 V DCmaster converters of each 2 kW (A3486H) also suited for operation at hostile environments. The crates house two types of electronic cards, one of 4 channels of 2.5 V/7 A (A4602) feeding the service electronics on the supply tubes (auxiliary power), while the other (A4603H) deliver 2 complex channels of each 2 low (1.75 V/7 A and 2.5 V/15 A) and 2 high voltage lines (\u0000600 V/20 mA) for ROC and sensor biasing respectively. Each of these channels contains \ufb02oat- ing pulse-width-modulated DC/DC switching transformers with a common ground return for the 1.75 and 2.5 V lines. The isolation resistance (ground return versus earth on the racks) is typically 100Wat 5 MHz. Every card is controlled by an optically decoupled microprocessor for setting and measuring voltages, currents, ramp times, trip parameters, interlocks and others. The DC levels are regulated over sense lines. The reaction time of the sensing circuit (typi- cally 200 ms) is subject to \ufb01ne tuning to comply with capacitive load, cable impedance and length (typically 50 m). The line drop in the cables amounts to roughly 2 V , while the regulators would allow for a maximum of 6 V .

Each of these groups draws a typical current of 4.6 A on the analogue (1.75 V) and 9 A on the digital (2.5 V) line respectively. The large current reserve of the supplies is needed to comply with conditions during bootstrapping where the ROCs remain brie\ufb02y in an unde\ufb01ned state. It was \u2013 53 \u2013 2008 JINST 3 S08004veri\ufb01ed that the regulators undergo a smooth transition from the constant-voltage to the constant- current regime if the programmed current limits are approached. Beside microprocessor controlled actions (1 s) fast over-current security is guaranteed by various solid state fuses (10 ms) as well as crowbars (100 ms) for over-voltage. Noise levels are typically 5 mV ppon the LV and 50 mV ppon the HV outputs which can easily be accepted thanks to the LV regulators in the ROCs and the intrinsically small sensor capacitances respectively. Of major concern in the overall design were fast drops in the digital current con- sumption (2.5 V line) in case of low ROC activity like in orbit gaps. Due to the cable inductance a typical current drop of 2 A per group generates over-voltage spikes at the module level in the order of some V olts depending on local buffer capacitors. The integrity of the cable-module-ROC circuit was therefore checked by a full simulation in SPICE together with measurements on pulsed current loads.

Inductance, capacitance and characteristic impedance between two of the main lines were measured to be 6 mH/m, 0.13 nF/m and 24 Wrespectively. The 4 m connection between PP1 and PP0 (tracker bulkhead) uses Al conductors in the cable. The auxiliary power cable is also shielded and contains 26\u0002 0.75 mm2and 4 twisted pair copper lines with 0.1 mm2for the sense wires. 3.2.7 Cooling The power consumption per pixel amounts to around 55 mW, including about 13 mW from the sensor leakage current at \ufb01nal \ufb02uences of 6\u0002 1014/cm2.

Its tasks are to monitor temperatures and humidities at different locations \u2013 54 \u2013 2008 JINST 3 S08004of the detector and to monitor and control the high and low voltages necessary for operation of the on-detector electronics. The monitoring of temperatures and humidities is based on a commercial Siemens S7\u2013300 modular mini Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) system. The Siemens S7\u2013300 system mon- itors a total of 192 temperature and 8 humidity sensors installed in the Pixel barrel and forward endcap disks. For the temperature sensors, platinum resistance temperature detection sensors with a nominal resistance of 1 kW (Pt1000 RTD) have been chosen. The measurement of humidity is based on detecting the water vapor induced shear stress in a small polymer element that is con- nected to a Wheatstone Bridge piezoresistor circuit [33]. This circuit provides a small (mV) output signal that is linearly proportional to relative humidity (RH) between the full range of 0% to 100% RH and is ampli\ufb01ed by the same kind of conditioning electronics that is used by the silicon strip tracker. The PLC of the Siemens S7\u2013300 system is programmed in the Statement List (STL) language [34] to convert the currents and voltages of the temperature and humidity sensors into calibrated physical units (i.e. degrees Celsius for temperatures and percentages for humidities).

The temperatures recorded by the DAQ system are passed to the slow controls system by means of a dedicated software interface [35]. The Barrel and Forward Pixel slow controls system is integrated into the PVSS graphical user interface (chapter 9) of the main CMS DCS. 3.3 Silicon strip tracker 3.3.1 Silicon sensors The sensor elements in the strip tracker are single sided p-on-n type silicon micro-strip sen- sors [36, 37]. They have been manufactured on 6 inch wafers in a standard planar process, leading to signi\ufb01cant cost reduction per unit area when compared to the more traditional 4 inch wafers. The base material is ndoped \ufb02oat zone silicon with h100i crystal orientation. This crystal ori- entation was preferred over the more common h111i orientation because measurements [38] have shown that the built-up of surface charge on h100i wafers due to irradiation is much smaller and consequently irradiation causes less inter-strip capacitance increase on this material. In TIB/TID and on the inner 4 rings of the TECs (\ufb01gure 3.1), thin sensors of (320\u000620)mm wafer thickness are used, with substrate resistivity of r=1:55\u00003:25kW cm. TOB and the outer 3 rings of the TECs are equipped with thicker sensors of (500\u000620)mm thickness, with substrate resistivity of r=4\u00008kW cm. Due to the single sided processing, these sensors show a signi\ufb01cant bow, which is required to be less than 100 mm.

On the front side, strip shaped diodes are formed by p+implantation into the ntype bulk. Due to the radiation damage to the crystal lattice, the bulk material will undergo type inversion and change to ptype. At this point, the pnjunction moves from the strip side of the wafer to the rear side contact. Each implanted strip is covered by an aluminium strip from which it is electrically insulated by means of a silicon oxide and nitride multilayer. This integrated capacitor allows for AC coupling of the signals from the strips to the read-out electronics, which is thus protected from the high leakage currents after irradiation. Each metal strip has two bond pads on each end, which are used to make a wire bond connection to the read-out chip and in case of the daisy chained sensors to make a wire bond connection between the two sensors in one detector module. For testing purposes there is also a DC pad connected to the p+implant. Each strip implant is connected via a (1:5\u00060:5)MW polysilicon bias resistor to a p+bias ring which encloses the strip region and also de\ufb01nes the active area of the sensor. For all sensors in the CMS strip tracker the ratio of p+implant width over strip pitch is w=p=0:25, leading to a uniform total strip capacitance per unit length of about 1: 2 pF/cm across all sensor geometries [38].

The aluminium strips feature a metal overhang of 4 to 8 mm on each side of the strip which pushes the high \ufb01eld region into the silicon oxide where the breakdown voltage is much higher, leading to stable high voltage operation. For the same reason, the bias ring is surrounded by a \ufb02oating guard ring p+implant. It gradually degrades the electric \ufb01eld between the n+implant at the cut edge of the sensor and the bias ring, which are at backplane potential (high voltage) and ground, respectively. Figure 3.19 shows the layout of a corner of the active region of a sensor. In order to equip all regions in the CMS tracker, 15 different sensor geometries are needed [36] (\ufb01gure 3.19): two rectangular sensor types each for TIB and TOB, and 11 wedge- shaped sensor types for TEC and TID. They have either 512 or 768 strips, re\ufb02ecting the read-out modularity of 256 channels (two 128-channel front-end chips multiplexed to one read-out channel).

The total number of silicon sensors in the strip tracker is 24 244, making up a total active area of 198m2, with about 9.3 million of strips [36]. 3.3.2 Read-out system The signals from the silicon sensors are ampli\ufb01ed, shaped, and stored by a custom integrated cir- cuit, the APV25 [39].

This pipeline is used to store the data for a trigger latency of up to 4 ms and to buffer it. A subsequent stage can either pass the signal as sampled at the maximum of the 50ns pulse (peak mode) or form a weighted sum of three consecutive samples which effectively reduces the shaping time to 25ns (deconvolution mode). The latter is needed at high luminosity in order to con\ufb01ne the signals to the correct LHC bunch crossing. The pulse shape depends linearly (linearity better than 5%) on the signal up to a charge corresponding to 5 minimum ionizing particles (MIPs, one MIP is equivalent to 25 000 electrons in this case), with a gradual fall off beyond. When a trigger is received, the analogue data from all 128 channels of the appropriate time slice in the pipeline are multiplexed and output at a rate of 20 MS/s (mega-samples per second) as a differential bi-directional current signal, together with a digital header.

Mainly due to the MOSFET characteristics, the noise reduces with temperature approximately as ENC\u0018p T. Therefore, the noise at operating temperature is about 10% lower. More than 100 APV25 chips from all production lots have been irradiated with X-rays to 10 Mrad ionizing dose, in excess of the expectation for 10 years of LHC operation. No signi\ufb01cant degradation in pulse shape or noise level has been observed. The APV25 is fabricated on 8 inch wafers with 360 chips per wafer. More than 600 wafers corresponding to 216 000 chips have been manufactured and probe-tested. After initial yield prob- lems were solved, an average yield of 88% was achieved.

All modules are supported by a frame made of carbon \ufb01ber or graphite, depending on the position in the tracker. A Kapton circuit layer is used to insulate the silicon from the module frame and to provide the electrical connection to the sensor back plane, i.e. bias voltage supply and temperature probe read-out. In addition the module frame carries the front-end hybrid and the pitch adapter. Figure 3.22 shows an exploded view and a photograph of a TEC module. Modules for the inner barrel, the inner disks and rings 1 to 4 in the endcaps are equipped with one sensor, modules in the outer barrel and rings 5 to 7 in the endcaps have two sensors. In the case of two sensors, their corresponding strips are connected electrically via wire bonds.

The two innermost layers host double sided modules with a strip pitch of 80 mm, while the outer two layers host single sided modules with a strip pitch of 120 mm. Each cylinder is subdivided into four sub-assemblies (\u0006 z, up/down) for ease of handling and integration. Each of these sub-assemblies (half-shells) hosts an independent array of services from cooling to electronics and thus can be fully equipped and tested before being mechanically coupled to each other during \ufb01nal assembly. \u2013 64 \u2013 2008 JINST 3 S08004 TIB/TID + with the margherita .Layer 4 shellsService cylinder (disks are hidden inside) Electrical power patch panels Optical fibres patch panel SilicondetectorsFigure 3.24: Schematic drawing of the TIB/TID+ subassembly.

These service cylinders play a dual role: one is to route out services from the shells to the margherita, the other is to support the Tracker Inner Disks (TID) which sit inside them. Figure 3.24 shows a schematic drawing of one half TIB/TID structure together with its corresponding margherita. The TID\u0006 are assemblies of three disks placed in zbetween\u0006800mm and\u0006900mm. The disks are identical and each one consists of three rings which span the radius from roughly 200 mm to 500 mm. The two innermost rings host back-to-back modules while the outer one hosts single sided ones. Just like the TIB shells each individual ring can be fully equipped and tested inde- pendently of the others before \ufb01nal assembly. Together the full TIB/TID guarantee hermetical coverage up to pseudorapidity h=2:5. All mechanical parts like shells, disks and service cylinders are made of high strength low deformation carbon \ufb01ber chosen both for its lightness and its low material budget. The margherita is instead made of conventional G-10 \ufb01ber epoxy with 30 mm copper on both sides. The silicon detector modules are mounted directly on the structure\u2019s shells and rings.

{"source": "The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf", "text": "For the TIB/TID the decision was made to use aluminium piping of 6mm cross section and 0: 3mm wall thickness. These pipes are bent into loops and soldered to inlet/outlet manifolds which connect several loops in parallel. The thermal connection between pipes and silicon modules is made with aluminium ledges which are glued to the pipes. On each ledge there are two threaded M1 holes onto which the modules are tightened. For the TIB each loop hosts three modules placed in straight row (\ufb01gure 3.25), while in the TID arrangements are more varied even though the number of modules per cooling loop is similar. Since the position of the ledges de\ufb01nes the position in space of the modules, after the glue has hardened the whole half cylinder is surveyed with a precision measuring machine. Before gluing, the circuits are tested individually for leaks both at cold temperatures (\u0000 30\u00b0C) and at high pressure (20 bars). It is only after the survey that the TIB cylinders (or TID disks) are available for the integration of the electrical parts including the detector modules. The dimensions of the cooling circuit vary from layer to layer and depend on the amount of power dissipated by the modules used for that speci\ufb01c layer. The cooling circuits vary from a minimum of four loops (12 modules equivalent) for the double sided layers to a maximum of 15 loops for the outer single sided ones where individual module heat dissipation is much lower. The TIB/TID uses a total of 70 independent cooling circuits so that in case of an accidental break in one of the circuits only a small part of the tracker is affected. The TIB thus is organized in three module ladders (the cooling loop) which cover the outer and inner surface of the four"}

The same concept applies to the TID with the only difference that the number of modules per cooling loop varies with the ring radius. The electrical grouping which we now describe takes this mechanical distribution into account. Electrical grouping The modules have been grouped together electrically. The basic group consists of three modules which sit on any given cooling loop (\ufb01gure 3.25). The three modules are interconnected through a Kapton circuit (mother cable) through which powering, detector biasing and controls are dis- tributed. At the top of a mother cable sits a CCUM which takes care of clock, trigger and I2C distribution. These mother cables are then electrically joined in a more complex group called the control ring which distributes trigger, clock and slow control signals to the CCUMs. Control ring groups never straddle two different cooling loops and are dimensioned so that a reasonable com- promise between granularity and complexity is achieved. Control rings in the TIB/TID make use of a unit called the DOHM (Digital opto-hybrid module) which receives all the signals from the optical \ufb01bers coming from the front end controllers (FEC) and converts them to electrical LVDS signals that are then distributed to up to 45 detector modules (15 mother cables) via CCUs. Given the high number of modules belonging to a Control Ring, TIB/TID has implemented redundancy in its DOHM hardware. \u2013 66 \u2013 2008 JINST 3 S08004 iFigure 3.25: Three TIB modules mounted on a layer 3 shell.

Power groups are contained within a con- trol ring (i.e. there is no straddling across control ring boundaries) and are fed by a speci\ufb01c power supply unit (PSU) developed for the tracker which also supplies HV biasing for the detectors. Analog signals from the detector front end are converted to optical by analog opto-hybrids which sit next to the silicon modules and are connected directly to the front end hybrids. Thus the system is completely optically decoupled from the DAQ which helps preserve signal integrity while avoiding ground loops. Grounding of the TIB/TID relies on the cooling circuits which are made of aluminium. The return current wires are connected to the cooling manifolds for all mother cables and DOHMs. The cooling inlet and outlet pipes run along the service cylinder across the margherita, making electrical contact with it. Outside the tracker volume these pipes are then connected to the CMS detector ground. Power cable shields are connected to the margherita which hosts all of the connectors. All detector modules have their own carbon \ufb01ber frame directly connected to the front end hybrid local ground. The shells are grounded through the cooling manifolds. 3.3.5 Tracker Outer Barrel (TOB) Mechanical structure and layout The Tracker Outer Barrel consists of a single mechanical structure (wheel ) supporting 688 self- contained sub-assemblies, called rods. The wheel is composed by four identical disks joined by three outer and three inner cylin- ders (\ufb01gure 3.26). Disks and cylinders are made of carbon \ufb01ber epoxy laminate.

With cabling at its two ends the TOB has a total length of 2360 mm. The openings in the disks form six detection layers with average radii of 608, 692, 780, 868, 965, 1080 mm. Within each layer, the centers of gravity of the rods are displaced by \u000616 mm with respect to the average radius of the layer, thus allowing for overlap in fand therefore full coverage within each layer. The rod mechanics are designed in such a way to implement overlap of the silicon sensors at z=0.

In addition, copper strips as long as the whole TOB are added on the outer surface of the outer cylinder (visible in \ufb01gure 3.26); for the inner cylinder instead, which is inside the tracking volume, it was decided to rely on the conductivity of the carbon \ufb01ber. Such design of the grounding scheme ensures good electrical connection of mechanical struc- tures and power return lines making ef\ufb01cient use of the existing conductive materials (cooling pipes and carbon \ufb01ber parts), with minimal amount of added metallic elements. \u2013 72 \u2013 2008 JINST 3 S080043.3.6 Tracker EndCaps (TEC) Mechanical structure The endcaps extend radially from 220 mm to 1135 mm and from \u00061240 mm to\u00062800 mm along thez-direction. The two endcaps are called TEC+ and TEC- (according to their location in zin the CMS coordinate system). Each endcap consists of nine disks that carry substructures on which the individual detector modules are mounted plus an additional two disks serving as front/back termi- nation. A sketch of one endcap and a photograph of the completed TEC+ is shown in \ufb01gures 3.30 and3.31. Eight U-pro\ufb01les, referred to as service channels because all services are grouped in their vicinity, join the disks together along their outer periphery, while at its inner diameter each disk is attached at four points to an inner support tube.

Each TEC LV group is supplied by one so-called multiservice cable, which transmits the analogue power and the bias voltage and brings out signals from temperature or humidity sensors.

Alignment of the tracker relies on three key components: the various data about assembly gathered during the integration process, the Laser Alignment System and the alignment with tracks, ordered by increasing precision and availability with time. For alignment purposes, modules with two sensors are treated as they would have one large sensor with identical active area coverage.

The CMS tracker alignment task thus consists of the determination of three translational and three rotational parameters for each of the 15 148 tracker modules.

It operates globally on tracker substructures (TIB, TOB and TEC discs) and cannot determine the position of individual modules. The goal of the system is to generate alignment information on a continuous basis, providing ge- ometry reconstruction of the tracker substructures at the level of 100 mm, which is mandatory for track pattern recognition and for the High Level Trigger. In addition, possible tracker structure movements can be monitored at the level of 10 mm, providing additional input for the track based alignment.

To obtain optimal signals on all sensors, a sequence of laser pulses with increasing intensities, optimized for each position, is generated. Several triggers per intensity are taken and the signals are averaged. In total, a few hundred triggers are needed to get a full picture of the alignment of the tracker structure. Since the trigger rate for the alignment system is around 100 Hz, this will take only a few seconds. These data will be taken at regular intervals, both in dedicated runs and during physics data taking. Alignment with tracks CMS pursues the development of two novel track-based alignment algorithms that allow to quickly solve the system of linear equations of order O(100 000). The \ufb01rst is an extension to the well- known global Millepede algorithm [52], that takes all correlations into account and has been shown to successfully align the most sensitive 50 000 parameters. The second is a novel approach using a Kalman Filter [53], which bridges the gap between global and local algorithms by taking into account the most important correlations. In addition the HIP [54] algorithm, which is local in the sense that it takes into account only correlations of parameters within a module, is developed in parallel. In this algorithm, correlations between modules are dealt with implicitly by iterating the alignment many times. All three methods are expected to be able to provide alignment constants for the full silicon pixel and strip tracker.

Assuming that a MIP creates 24 000 electrons in a 300 mm thick layer of silicon [16], and assuming that the beam particles can be treated as MIPs, the S/N can be used to calculate the equivalent noise charge, ENC. The common mode subtracted noise depends on the capacitance of the sensor, which depends linearly on the strip length and the ratio between strip width and pitch, w=p[16]. Since w=p=0:25 for all sensor types, the ENC varies between different module types according to the strip length. Results for all module types except W1TID are summarized in table 3.3. Measurements performed at low temperature (for the TEC, typically hybrid temperatures of+10\u00b0C and 0\u00b0C were reached for hybrids with six and four APVs, respectively) are plotted versus the strip length in \ufb01gure 3.36.

Although no dedicated beam telescope was available, ef\ufb01ciency studies have been performed both with the TOB and TEC setups, exploiting the fact that in both cases the beam penetrated several layers of modules. Ef\ufb01ciencies of above 99% have been observed in all such studies. The uniformity of the module performance along and perpendicular to the strip direction has been studied in 2003 with several TIB modules in a test beam experiment at the X5 complex. Two single-sided strings equipped with IB2 modules were mounted on a structure corresponding to a portion of a layer 3 half-shell, and operated at room temperature. To study the uniformity across the strips, the strips read out by three APVs (on two different modules) were exposed to a pion beam, and between 1000 and 8000 events were collected per strip. A cluster was associated to a strip if the centre of gravity xof the cluster was reconstructed within (n\u00000:5)\u0001p<x<(n+0:5)\u0001pfor strip n and pitch p. The uniformity, de\ufb01ned as the ratio between the RMS and the mean of the respective distribution, was 1.3% for the cluster noise, with an increase close to the APV chip edges. The cluster charge uniformity was of the order of 1.4%, but dropped to 0.5% if calculated separately for groups of 32 adjacent strips. A uniformity of the S/N of 1.6% on average and of 1.0% for groups of 32 strips was measured. To investigate the uniformity along the strips, a muon beam was used for its uniform particle density.

Both the uniformity of cluster charge and S/N were found to be 1.4%. Performance during integration Testing during integration consisted typically of checks of the control ring functionality, tests of the I2C communication of all chips, tests of the gain of the optical connections, commissioning (i.e. tuning of chip operation parameters), pedestal runs in peak and deconvolution mode, bias voltage ramping up to 450 V , read-out of currents and module and hybrid temperatures through the DCUs, and a functionality check of the temperature and humidity sensors.

Most of the problems are assumed to be caused by mishandling during insertion or cabling. Since the exchange of components bears a consid- erable risk, not all defective components have been exchanged. Additional defects could be introduced by any following handling step, such as cabling of the tracker. The numbers given below should thus be regarded as a snapshot re\ufb02ecting the situation right after integration of the single sub-detectors. TEC Performance during integration The TEC petals were integrated sector-wise, where one sector corresponds to one eighth of a TEC inf, and comprises 18 petals that share nine control rings and four cooling circuits. After integra- tion of one sector, a read-out test of the full sector was performed at room temperature, with the coolant at +15\u00b0C and mean silicon and hybrid temperatures of about +23\u00b0C and +33\u00b0C, respec- tively. During integration a \ufb02aw in the crimping of the connectors of the multiservice power cables was found. After all such connectors had been replaced on both TECs, the system performance observed during integration was very robust. In \ufb01gure 3.37, left side, the common mode subtracted noise of all strips of both TECs is shown for deconvolution mode. Since the measured noise depends on the gain of the optical chain, the noise was normalized to the digital output of the APV (scale on upper x-axis in \ufb01gure 3.37). In addition, the number of ADC counts in the FED was converted to ENC according to the following method: with a nominal digital APV output of \u00064 mA and a nominal"}

This method allows a direct comparison of the measurements from different optical channels and delivers an approximate absolute calibration of the equivalent noise charge. Cross-checks with cosmic muon data performed during TIB/TID integration indicate that this scaling agrees with the real ENC within 10\u201320%. Furthermore, the noise depends on the strip capacitance and thus on the strip length, i.e. on the module type. For this reason the noise of all strips was normalized to the strip length of modules of ring 1 (8.52 cm). In addition a correction was applied to TEC- data to account for the fact that they were taken with other chip parameter settings than TEC+ data. The common mode subtraction was performed assuming a constant common mode per APV . To extract the mean noise, a gaussian was \ufb01tted to the distribution. The resulting mean common mode subtracted noise amounts to 1693 \u000675 electrons in this normalization. The mean common mode noise, calculated per APV , amounts to (22 \u00064)% and (21\u00063)% of the mean intrinsic noise in peak and deconvolution mode, respectively (\ufb01gure 3.38, left, for all non-defective APVs of TEC+). The \ufb02atness of the noise across the APV is a good indicator for the quality of the grounding. The relative spread of the total noise (before common mode subtraction), i.e. the RMS of the noise divided by the mean noise, both calculated per APV , can be used to quantify the \ufb02atness. The relative spread is (2: 5\u00060:2)% in both read-out modes, as shown in \ufb01gure 3.38, right, indicating that the grounding scheme implemented by the TEC works well.

Irradiation studies As already discussed in detail in section 3.1.1, the silicon strip tracker will suffer from a severe level of radiation during its 10 year long lifetime: up to 1 :8\u00021014neqcm\u00002for TIB/TID and TEC and up to 0: 5\u00021014neqcm\u00002for TOB, assuming an integrated luminosity of 500 fb\u00001. The radial andzdependence of the \ufb02uence both for fast hadrons and neutrons is described in detail in [15, 16]. Hadrons are expected to dominate in the inner part of the tracker, up to a radius of about 0.5 m, while neutrons backscattered off the electromagnetic calorimeter dominate further outside. Safety factors of 1.5 and 2.0 on the \ufb02uence are typically applied for TIB/TID and TOB/TEC, respectively.

Neutron irradiation was usually performed at the isochronous cy- clotron of the Centre de Recherches du Cyclotron, Louvain-la-Neuve, which delivers neutrons with a mean energy of 20 MeV (hardness factor 1.95 relative to 1 MeV neutrons [58]). Proton irradiation has been carried out e.g. at the compact cyclotron of the Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe, where a 26 MeV proton beam (hardness factor 1.85 relative to 1 MeV neutrons) with a current of 100 mA and a beam spot diameter of 1 cm is available. To study the performance of complete irradiated modules, several OB1 and OB2 modules (table 3.3for explanation) were irradiated with a proton \ufb02uence ranging from 0: 1\u00021014neqcm\u00002 to 0: 7\u00021014neqcm\u00002, and one OB2 module was subjected to a neutron \ufb02uence of about 1:2\u00021014neqcm\u00002[57]. Two TEC W5 modules were irradiated with a proton \ufb02uence of about 1: 1\u00021014neqcm\u00002, and three TIB IB1 modules were subjected to a proton \ufb02uence of 0:5\u00021014neqcm\u00002to 2:1\u00021014neqcm\u00002.

A preshower detector is placed in front of the endcap crystals. Avalanche photodiodes (APDs) are used as photodetectors in the barrel and vacuum phototriodes (VPTs) in the endcaps. The use of high density crystals has allowed the design of a calorimeter which is fast, has \ufb01ne granularity and is radiation resistant, all important characteristics in the LHC environment. One of the driving criteria in the design was the capability to detect the decay to two photons of the postulated Higgs boson. This capability is enhanced by the good energy resolution provided by a homogeneous crystal calorimeter. 4.1 Lead tungstate crystals The characteristics [62] of the PbWO 4crystals make them an appropriate choice for operation at LHC. The high density (8.28 g/cm3), short radiation length (0.89 cm) and small Moli\u00e8re radius (2.2 cm) result in a \ufb01ne granularity and a compact calorimeter. In recent years, PbWO 4scintil- lation properties and other qualities have been progressively improved, leading to the mass pro- duction of optically clear, fast and radiation-hard crystals [63, 64]. The scintillation decay time of these production crystals is of the same order of magnitude as the LHC bunch crossing time: about 80% of the light"}

To exploit the total internal re\ufb02ection for optimum light collection on the photodetector, the crystals are polished after machining. For fully polished crystals, the truncated pyramidal shape makes the light collection non-uniform along the crystal length. The effect is large because of the high refractive index (n =2:29 around the peak wavelength [67]) and the needed uniformity [68] is achieved by depolishing one lateral face. In the endcaps, the light collection is naturally more uniform because the crystal faces are nearly parallel.

The crystals are contained in a thin-walled alveolar structure (submodule).

The submodule cantilever is reduced by the action of a 4-mm thick cylindrical plate where the front of the submodules are supported by setpins. Not all the submodules are connected to the cylindrical plate but only four rows in f from a total of ten.

The screening and testing aimed to ensure reliable operation for 10 years under high luminosity LHC conditions for over 99% of the APDs installed in the ECAL [75]. Based on tests with hadron irradiations [76] it is expected that the dark current after such operation will have risen to about 5 mA, but that no other properties will have changed. Small samples of APDs were irradiated with a251Cf source to monitor the effectiveness of the screening procedure in selecting radiation resistant APDs. The gain stability directly affects the ECAL energy resolution. Since the APD gain has a high dependence on the bias voltage (a V=1=MdM=dV'3:1%=V at gain 50), to keep this contribution to the resolution at the level of per mille, the APDs require a very stable power supply system: the stability of the voltage has to be of the order of few tens of mV ."}

The \ufb02ags are composed of 3 bits, indicating the suppression level that must be applied to the associated read-out units. 4.5.2 The trigger and read-out paths The ECAL data, in the form of trigger primitives, are sent to the Level-1 calorimeter trigger proces- sor, for each bunch crossing.

In the endcaps, the read-out modularity maps onto the 5\u0002 5 mechanical units (supercrystals). However the sizes of the trigger towers vary in order to approximately follow the h,fgeometry of the HCAL and Level-1 trigger processor. The supercrystals are divided into groups of 5 contiguous crystals. These groups are of variable shape and referred to as pseudo-strips. The trigger towers are composed of several pseudo-strips and may extend over more than one supercrystal. Since the read-out structure does not match the trigger structure, only the pseudo-strip summations are performed on the detector. The total transverse energy of the trigger tower is computed by the off-detector electronics. Hence, each endcap FE board is served by 6 optical links, 5 of them being used to transmit the trigger primitives. As in the barrel an electrical serial link transmits the clock, control and Level-1 trigger signals. After time alignment the ECAL trigger primitives are sent at 1.2 Gb/s to the regional calorime- ter trigger, via 10-m-long electrical cables, where together with HCAL trigger primitives, the elec- tron/photon and jets candidates are computed as well as the total transverse energy. 4.5.3 Algorithms performed by the trigger primitive generation The TPG logic implemented on the FE boards combines the digitized samples delivered by the VFE boards to determine the trigger primitives and the bunch crossing to which they should be assigned. The logic must reconstruct the signal amplitude to be assigned to each bunchcrossing from the continuous stream of successive digitizations.

The signal processing performed in the VFE and FE barrel electronics has a total duration of only 17 clock cycles. The remaining part of the latency is mainly due to formatting and time alignment of the digital signals. Ideally, the output of this processing should be a stream of zeroes, unless there is a signal in the tower resulting from a bunch crossing exactly 17 clock cycles before. In this case the output is a word encoding the summed transverse energy in the tower together with the \ufb01ne-grain bit. The endcap pipeline is split between the on-detector and off-detector electronics and implements very similar algorithms. The trigger primitives are expected to be delivered to the regional calorimeter trigger in 50 clock cycles in the endcap case. 4.5.4 Classi\ufb01cation performed by the selective read-out About 100kB per event has been allocated for ECAL data. The full ECAL data for an event, if all channels are read out, exceeds this target by a factor of nearly 20. Reduction of the data volume, selective read-out, can be performed by the Selective Read-out Processor [86, 91] so that the suppression applied to a channel takes account of energy deposits in the vicinity.

These classi\ufb01cations can be used \ufb02exibly to implement a range of algorithms by using differ- ent thresholds to de\ufb01ne the classes, and different suppression levels for the read-out of the channels within each class. The algorithm currently used in the simulation provides adequate data reduction even at high luminosity. The algorithm functions as follows: if a trigger tower belongs to the high interest class (E T>5 GeV) then the crystals of this trigger tower and of its neighbour trigger towers (225 crystals in total in the barrel case) are read with no zero suppression. If a trigger tower belongs to the medium interest class (E T>2:5 GeV), then the crystals of this trigger tower (25 crystals in the barrel case) are read with no suppression. If a trigger tower belongs to the low interest class and it is not the neighbour of a high interest trigger tower, then the crystals in it are read with zero suppression at about 3s noise. For debugging purposes, the selective read-out can be deactivated and either a global zero suppression (same threshold for every channel) or no zero suppression applied.

A major design consideration is that all lead is covered by silicon sensors, including the effects of shower spread, primary vertex spread etc. For optimum Level-1 trigger performance the pro\ufb01le of the outer edge of the lead should follow the shape of the ECAL crystals behind it.

The functionalities include the independent con\ufb01guration of the HV channels with various set of voltages, the monitor of the voltage and the current delivered by each channel and the database recording of the settings. The ECAL Safety System can switch off the HV via the individual board interlocks. The ECAL ampli\ufb01cation and digitization electronics located on the VFE electronics cards require a very stable low voltage to maintain constant signal ampli\ufb01cation. The system uses Low V oltage Regulators that guarantee the required stability of the signal ampli\ufb01cation. The Low V olt- age Regulator Boards are equipped with DCUs that measure the voltages and these measurements are read via the Token Ring. Overall the power is supplied by MARATON crates (WIENER), which are operated and monitored by the DCS. 4.8 Detector calibration Calibration is a severe technical challenge for the operation of the CMS ECAL. Many small effects which are negligible at low precision need to be treated with care as the level of precision of a few per mille is approached. ECAL calibration is naturally seen as composed of a global component, giving the absolute energy scale, and a channel-to-channel relative component, which is referred to as intercalibration. The essential issues are uniformity over the whole ECAL and stability, so that showers"}

The main source of channel-to-channel response variation in the barrel is the crystal-to-crystal variation of scintillation light yield which has an RMS of \u00198% within most supermodules, al- though the total variation among all barrel crystals is \u001915%. In the endcap the VPT signal yield, the product of the gain, quantum ef\ufb01ciency and photocathode area, has an RMS variation of al- most 25%. Preliminary estimates of the intercalibration coef\ufb01cients are obtained from laboratory measurements of crystal light yield and photodetector/electronics response [101]. Applying this information reduces the channel-to-channel variation to less than 5% in the barrel and less than 10% in the endcaps. All 36 supermodules were commissioned in turn by operating them on a cosmic ray stand for a period of about one week. A muon traversing the full length of a crystal deposits an energy of approximately 250 MeV , permitting intercalibration information to be obtained for the barrel ECAL [102]. In 2006, nine supermodules were intercalibrated with high energy electrons (90 and 120 GeV), in a geometrical con\ufb01guration that reproduced the incidence of particles during CMS operation. One of the supermodules was exposed to the beam on two occasions, separated by an interval of one month. The resulting sets of inter-calibration coef\ufb01cients are in close agreement, the distribution of differences having an RMS spread of 0.27%, indicating a reproducibility within the statistical precision of the individual measurements (\ufb01gure 4.12). A comparison of the cosmic ray and high energy electron data demonstrates that the precision of the cosmic ray inter-calibration is better than 1.5% over most of the volume of a supermodule, rising to just above 2% at the outer end (corresponding to h\u00191:5).

The ultimate intercalibration precision will be achieved in situ with physics events. As a \ufb01rst step, imposing the f-independence of the energy deposited in the calorimeter can be used to rapidly con\ufb01rm, and possibly improve on, the start-up intercalibration within \ufb01xed hregions. The intercalibration method that has been investigated in the most detail uses the momentum of isolated electrons measured in the tracker. These electrons, mainly from W!en, are abundant (s\u001920 nb) and have a similar pTto the photons of the benchmark channel H!gg. A complementary method, not relying on the tracker momentum measurement, is based on p0!ggandh!ggmass recon- struction. Most methods of intercalibration will be local to a region of the ECAL, and a further step intercalibrating these regions to one another will be needed. This is a consequence of the signi\ufb01cant systematic variations that occur as a function of pseudorapidity such as (or including): the large variation of the thickness of the tracker material, the variation of the structure of the ECAL (both the major differences between the barrel and endcap, and the small continuous variation of the ge- ometry along the length of the barrel), and the variation of background characteristics for p0!gg.

Where there is a source of signi\ufb01cant variation, as in the case of the changes in crystal transparency caused by irradiation and subsequent annealing, the variation must be precisely tracked by an independent measurement.

The \ufb01nal goal of calibration is to achieve the most accurate energy measurements for elec- trons and photons. Different reconstruction algorithms are used to estimate the energy of different electromagnetic objects, i.e., unconverted photons, electrons and converted photons, each of them having their own correction functions. At present these \u201calgorithmic\u201d corrections are obtained from the simulated data by accessing the generated parameters of the Monte Carlo simulation. For some of the corrections, for example the containment corrections, this is an acceptable procedure provided that test beam data is used to verify the simulation, so that, in effect, the simulation is being used only as a means of interpolating and extrapolating from data taken in the test beam. In other cases, where the test beam provides no useful information, for example in issues related to conversions and bremsstrahlung radiation in the tracker material, it will be important to \ufb01nd ways of using information that can be obtained from data taken in situ with the running detector. Two particularly useful channels which can be used to obtain such information, and also assist in the step of intercalibrating regions of the ECAL to one another, are under investigation: Z!e+e\u0000, andZ!m+m\u0000g(the photon coming from inner bremsstrahlung). \u2013 112 \u2013 2008 JINST 3 S08004 Figure 4.14: Simulation"}

For this illustrative example a luminosity of L=2\u00021033cm\u00002s\u00001was assumed, together with a machine cycle consisting of a 10 hour coast followed by 2 hours \ufb01lling time. The crystal behaviour under irradiation was modeled on data taken during a crystal irradiation in the test beam. 4.9 Laser monitor system Although radiation resistant, ECAL PbWO 4crystals show a limited but rapid loss of optical trans- mission under irradiation due to the production of colour centres which absorb a fraction of the transmitted light. At the ECAL working temperature (18\u00b0C) the damage anneals and the balance between damage and annealing results in a dose-rate dependent equilibrium of the optical trans- mission, if the dose rate is constant. In the varying conditions of LHC running the result is a cyclic transparency behaviour between LHC collision runs and machine re\ufb01lls (\ufb01gure 4.14). The magni- tude of the changes is dose-rate dependent, and is expected to range from 1 or 2 per cent at low luminosity in the barrel, to tens of per cent in the high hregions of the endcap at high luminosity. The performance of the calorimeter would be unacceptably degraded by these radiation induced transparency changes were they not measured and corrected for. The evolution of the crystal transparency is measured using laser pulses injected into the crystals via optical \ufb01bres. The response is normalized by the laser pulse magnitude measured using silicon PN photodiodes. PN type photodiodes were chosen because of their very narrow de- pletion zone (\u0019 7mm with +4 V reverse bias), making them much less sensitive to type inversion than the faster PIN photodiodes. Thus R(t) =APD( t)=PN (t)is used as the measure of the crystal transparency. The laser monitoring system [69] performing this task is brie\ufb02y outlined in"}

An example of this relationship is given in \ufb01gure 4.15. This power law describes well the behaviour of all the crystals that have been evaluated in the test beam, and this formula is expected to be valid in the barrel for both low and high luminosity at LHC. 4.9.1 Laser-monitoring system overview Figure 4.16 shows the basic components of the laser-monitoring system: two laser wavelengths are used for the basic source. One, blue, at l=440 nm, is very close to the scintillation emission peak, which is used to follow the changes in transparency due to radiation, and the other, near infra-red, at l=796 nm, is far from the emission peak, and very little affected by changes in transparency, which can be used to verify the stability of other elements in the system.

The contribution to the stochastic term coming from \ufb02uctuations in the lateral containment is expected to be about 1.5% when energy is reconstructed by summing an array of 5 \u00025 crystals, and about 2% when using 3\u0002 3 crystals. The photostatistics contribution is given by: ape=s F Npe(4.3) where Npeis the number of primary photoelectrons released in the photodetector per GeV , and F is the excess noise factor which parametrizes \ufb02uctuations in the gain process. This factor has a value close to 2 for the APDs, and is about 2.5 for the VPTs. A value of Npe\u00194500 pe/GeV is found for the barrel, giving \u00192:1% for the photostatistics contribution to the stochastic term. In the endcap the photostatistics contribution is similar, since the larger collection area of the VPT largely compensates for the reduced quantum ef\ufb01ciency of the photocathode. The contribution to the energy resolution from the preshower device can be approximately parametrized as a stochastic term with a value of 5%/p E, where Eis in GeV .

The effects of the longitudinal light collection curve have been studied in detail. Quite stringent requirements are made on the crystal longitudinal uniformity. Requiring the constant term contri- bution due to non-uniformity be less than 0.3%, sets a limit on the slope of the longitudinal light collection curve in the region of the shower maximum of \u00190:35% per radiation length. A small increase in response towards the rear of the crystal helps to compensate the rear leakage from late developing showers, which would otherwise cause a low energy tail. The required response is achieved in the barrel by depolishing one long face of the crystals to a designated roughness. This surface treatment is incorporated into the crystal production process. The effect of rear leakage is very small. Charged particles leaking from the back of the crystals can also give a direct signal in the APDs (nuclear counter effect), but test beam data show that this effect is negligible for isolated electromagnetic showers: no tails on the high side of the energy distribution are observed even at the highest electron energy tested (280 GeV). \u2013 118 \u2013 2008 JINST 3 S08004The noise term There are three contributions to the noise term: 1. electronics noise, 2. digitization noise, 3. pileup noise.

The noise measured, after this amplitude reconstruction, for channels in barrel supermodules is \u0019 40 MeV/channel in the highest gain range.

Its success is evidenced by the fact that, after this procedure, the noise in the sum of 25 channels is almost exactly 5 times the noise in a single channel [106]. In the endcap it is intended to sort the VPTs in bins of overall signal yield, which includes the photocathode area, the quantum ef\ufb01ciency and the VPT gain. The VPTs with higher overall signal yield are used for the larger radius regions of the endcap. This has the result that the transverse energy equivalent of the noise will be more or less constant, with a value of sET\u001950 MeV . Neutron irradiation of the APDs in the barrel induces a leakage current which contributes to the electronics noise. The evolution of the leakage current and induced noise over the lifetime of the experiment has been extensively studied. The expected contribution is equivalent to 8 MeV/channel after one year of operation at L=1033cm\u00002s\u00001, and 30 MeV/channel at the end of the \ufb01rst year of operation at L=1034cm\u00002s\u00001[69].

This constrains the total amount of material which can be put in to absorb the hadronic shower. Therefore, an outer hadron calorimeter or tail catcher is placed outside the solenoid complementing the barrel calorimeter. Beyond jhj=3, the forward hadron calorimeters placed at 11.2 m from the interaction point extend the pseudorapidity coverage down tojhj=5:2 using a Cherenkov-based, radiation-hard technology. The following sections describe these subdetectors in detail. 5.1 Barrel design (HB) The HB is a sampling calorimeter covering the pseudorapidity range jhj<1:3. The HB is divided into two half-barrel sections (\ufb01gure 5.2), each half-section being inserted from either end of the barrel cryostat of the superconducting solenoid and subsequently hung from rails in the median plane. Since the HB is very rigid compared to the cryostat, great care has been taken to ensure that the barrel load is distributed evenly along the rails [108]. Absorber geometry The HB consists of 36 identical azimuthal wedges which form the two half-barrels (HB+ and HB\u2013). The wedges are constructed out of \ufb02at brass absorber plates (table 5.1) aligned parallel to the beam axis. The numbering scheme of the wedges is shown in \ufb01gure 5.3. Each wedge is segmented into four azimuthal angle (f ) sectors. The plates are bolted together in a staggered geometry resulting in a con\ufb01guration that contains no projective dead material for the full radial extent of a wedge (\ufb01gure 5.4). The innermost and outermost plates are made of stainless steel for structural strength.

Since the calorimeter is inserted into the ends of a 4-T solenoidal magnet, the absorber must be made from a non-magnetic material. It must also have a maximum number of interaction lengths to contain hadronic showers, good mechanical properties and reasonable cost, leading to the choice of C26000 cartridge brass. The endcaps are attached to the muon endcap yoke as shown in \ufb01gures 5.11 and5.12.

Multipixel hybrid photodiodes (HPDs) are used as photodetectors due to their low sensitivity to magnetic \ufb01elds and their large dynamical range. \u2013 133 \u2013 2008 JINST 3 S08004 Figure 5.14: a) Basic structure of a scintillator tile with a groove to \ufb01x wavelength shifting \ufb01bre, b) cross section of the 3.7-mm-thick scintillator for layers 1\u201317, and c) cross section of the 9-mm- thick scintillator for layer zero. Two layers of re\ufb02ecting paint cover the side surfaces of the tile. Longitudinal segmentation The longitudinal segmentation of HE (\ufb01gure 5.10) is, in part, motivated by the radiation environ- ment. Correction of the calibration coef\ufb01cients after scintillator degradation can be applied, in order to restore the energy resolution. The towers nearest the beam line (27 and 28 plus guard ring \u201c29\u201d) have 3 divisions in depth which are read-out separately. The other towers (except 16 and 17 which overlap with the electromagnetic barrel calorimeter) have two longitudinal readouts for potential use during the time period when the electromagnetic endcap calorimeter (EE) may not yet be available. A special scintillator layer of 9 mm BC408 (layer 0) is installed in front of the absorber to partially correct for the different response of EE to electrons and hadrons and for particle absorption in the mechanical structure supporting EE. \u2013 134 \u2013 2008 JINST 3 S08004 Figure 5.15: The design of"}

To ensure adequate sampling depth for jhj<1:3, the hadron calorimeter is extended outside the solenoid with a tail catcher called the HO or outer calorimeter. The HO utilises the solenoid coil as an additional absorber equal to 1.4/sinq interaction lengths and is used to identify late starting showers and to measure the shower energy deposited after HB. Outside the vacuum tank of the solenoid, the magnetic \ufb01eld is returned through an iron yoke designed in the form of \ufb01ve 2.536 m wide (along z-axis) rings. The HO is placed as the \ufb01rst sensitive layer in each of these \ufb01ve rings. The rings are identi\ufb01ed by the numbers \u00002,\u00001, 0, +1,+2.

All other rings have a single HO layer at a radial distance of 4.07 m. The total depth of the calorimeter system is thus extended to a minimum of 11.8 lIexcept at the barrel-endcap boundary region. The HO is constrained by the geometry of the muon system. Figure 5.19 shows the position of HO layers in the rings of the muon stations in the overall CMS setup. The segmentation of these detectors closely follows that of the barrel muon system. Each ring has 12 identical f-sectors. The 12 sectors are separated by 75-mm-thick stainless steel beams which hold successive layers of iron of the return yoke as well as the muon system.

The HO consists of one (rings \u00061 and \u00062) or two (ring 0) layers of scintillator tiles located in front of the \ufb01rst layer of the barrel muon detector. Scintillation light from the tiles is collected using multi-clad Y11 Kuraray wavelength shifting (WLS) \ufb01bres of diameter 0.94 mm, and transported to the photo detectors located on the structure of the return yoke by splicing a multi-clad Kuraray clear \ufb01bre (also of 0.94 mm diameter) with the WLS \ufb01bre. In order to simplify installation of HO, the scintillator tiles are packed into a single unit called a tray. Each tray corresponds to one fslice (5\u000ewide in f). However, along the z (h) direction, a tray covers the entire span of a muon ring. Figure 5.20 shows a schematic view of a HO tray where one tile is mapped to a tower of HB and the optical cable from the tray is connected to the read-out box. The physics impact of HO has been studied [115] using a simulation of the CMS detector.

The effect of leakage is visible at h= 0 (ring 0) from 70 GeV , increasing with energy. The mean fraction of energy in HO increases from 0.38% for 10 GeV pions to 4.3% for 300 GeV pions. There is some evidence of leakage without HO in ring 1 but it is reduced due to the greater HB thickness at larger jhj. The amount of leakage in ring 2 is found to be negligible at energies below 300 GeV . The effect of shower leakage has a direct consequence on the measurement of missing trans- verse energy (Emiss T). Study of QCD events shows that the cross section for those events, where at least one particle has ETabove 500 GeV , is several pb. For these events the HO is useful to decrease the leakage and improve the Emiss Tmeasurement. Figure 5.22 shows the dijet integrated cross section for Emiss Tabove a certain value.

On average, 760 GeV per proton-proton interaction is deposited into the two forward calorimeters, compared to only 100 GeV for the rest of the detector. Moreover, this energy is not uniformly distributed but has a pronounced maximum at the highest rapidities. At jhj=5 after an integrated luminosity of 5 \u0002105pb\u00001(\u001910 years of LHC operation), the HF will experience \u001910 MGy. The charged hadron rates will also be extremely high.

This hostile environment presents a consider- able challenge to calorimetry, and the design of the HF calorimeter was \ufb01rst and foremost guided by the necessity to survive in these harsh conditions, preferably for at least a decade. Successful operation critically depends on the radiation hardness of the active material.

The signal is generated when charged shower particles above the Cherenkov threshold (E \u0015 190 keV for electrons) generate Cherenkov light, thereby rendering the calorimeter mostly sensitive to the electromagnetic component of showers [116]. A small fraction of the generated light is captured, ftrap=NA=2n2 core, where NA is the numerical aperture (NA =0:33\u00060:02) and ncore is the refractive index of the quartz core.

The read-out consists of an optical to electrical transducer followed by a fast charge-integrating ADC. The digital output of the ADC is transmitted for every bunch over a gigabit digital optical \ufb01bre to the service cavern, housing the off-detector electronics. In the service cavern, the signal is deserialized and used to construct trigger primitives which are sent to the calorimeter trigger. The data and trigger primitives are also pipelined for transmission to the DAQ upon a Level-1 Accept (L1A) decision. The optical signals from the scintillator-based detectors (HB/HE/HO) are converted to elec- trical signals using multichannel hybrid photodiodes (HPDs) which provide a gain of \u00192000. A detailed view of the scintillator-based front-end read-out chain is given in \ufb01gure 5.31. The optical signals from individual sampling layers are brought out on clear \ufb01bres. The \ufb01bres correspond- ing to a projective calorimeter tower are mapping via an optical decoding unit (ODU) to a cookie that interfaces to individual pixels on the HPD.

The digital outputs of three QIE channels are combined with some monitoring information to create a 32-bit data word. The 32-bit data, at a rate of 40 MHz, is fed into the Gigabit Optical Link (GOL) chip and transmitted using 8b/10b encoding off the detector to the service cavern. In the service cavern, the data is received by the HCAL Trigger/Read-out (HTR) board. The HTR board contains the Level-1 pipeline and also constructs the trigger primitives for HCAL. These trigger primitives are sent to the Regional Calorimeter trigger via Serial Link Board mezzanine cards. The HTR board receives data for 48 channels (16 data \ufb01bres) and may host up to six SLBs. When a L1A is received by the HTR through the TTC system, it prepares a packet of data for the DAQ including a programmable number of precision read-out values and trigger primitives around the triggered bunch crossing. For normal operations, the HTR will transmit 7 time samples for each non-zero channel and a single trigger primitive for every trigger tower. These packets of data, each covering 24 channels, are transmitted by LVDS to the HCAL Data Concentrator Card (DCC).

This allows each channel\u2019s integration phase to correct for differences in the time-of-\ufb02ight from the interaction region as well as differences in the optical pathlength within the detector. Figure 5.34 shows that scintillator tile signals produce relatively fast pulses such that 68% of the pulse is contained within a 25 ns window. Figure 5.35 shows the pulse shape for the for- ward calorimeter. The Cerenkov process and the phototubes used in the forward calorimeter are extremely fast, so the pulse in HF is only 10 ns wide. The HF is thus subject only to in-time pile-up which is important in the highly active forward region of CMS. An additional important effect on the HCAL pulse timing in HB/HE/HO comes from the input stage of the QIE. The QIE has an amplitude-dependent impedance which implies a faster pulse"}

The channel-by-channel bunch synchronization of HCAL will be determined using a his- togramming procedure in the serial link boards (SLBs) which determine the bunch synchroniza- tion using the beam structure of the LHC. The event and bunch synchronization is monitored using fast control signals originating from the TTC system which are transmitted in the data stream be- tween the front-ends and the HTR. On a global scale, the bunch and event synchronization between the HCAL and other detector subsystems is determined using muons and other correlated physics signals. 5.6 HF luminosity monitor The CMS luminosity measurement will be used to monitor the LHC\u2019s performance on a bunch-by- bunch basis in real time and to provide an overall normalization for physics analyses. The design goal for the real-time measurement is to determine the average luminosity with a 1% statistical accuracy with an update rate of 1 Hz. For of\ufb02ine analyses, the design goal is a systematic accuracy of 5%, although every reasonable effort will be made to produce a more accurate result. Both of these requirements must be met over a very large range of luminosities, extending from roughly 1028cm\u00002s\u00001to 1034cm\u00002s\u00001, and possibly beyond. A number of techniques capable of providing suitable luminosity information in real time have been identi\ufb01ed [17]. One technique employs signals from the forward hadron calorimeter (HF) while another, called the Pixel Luminosity Telescope (PLT), uses a set of purpose-built parti- cle tracking telescopes based on single-crystal diamond pixel detectors. At the time of writing, the PLT has not been formally approved, but is under study. The methods based"}

The \ufb01rst method is based on zero counting in which the average fraction of empty towers is used to infer the mean number of interactions per bunch crossing. The second method exploits the linear relationship between the average transverse energy per tower and the luminosity. Outputs of the QIE chips used to digitize the signals from the HF PMTs on a bunch-by-bunch basis are routed to a set of 36 HCAL Trigger and Read-out (HTR) boards, each of which services 24 HF physical towers. In order to derive a luminosity signal from the HTR, an additional mezzanine board called the HF luminosity transmitter (HLX) is mounted on each of the HTR boards. The HLX taps into the raw HF data stream and collects channel occupancy and ET-sum data and transmits them to a central collector node over standard 100-Mbps Ethernet. The HLX boards have the same form factor as the Synchronization and Link Boards (SLBs) used to interface the ECAL and HCAL readouts to the Regional Calorimeter Trigger (RCT) system. Although all HF channels can be read by the HLX, MC studies indicate that the best linearity for occupancy histograms is obtained using just two hrings. Hence two sets of two rings are used for the occupancy histograms. Four rings are combined to form the ET-sum histogram. The algorithm has been optimized to minimize sensitivity to pedestal drifts, gain changes and other related effects. Each of the two sets of rings sends 12 bits of data to the HLX. There are three occupancy histograms dedicated to each of the following possible states for each tower: enabled- below-threshold,"}
{"source": "The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf", "text": "over-threshold-1, over-threshold-2. In addition, a 15-bit ETsum value is sent to the HLX and a further histogram based on all 13 HF hrings is \ufb01lled for use by the LHC. As a result, the input to the HLX is used to create eight histograms: two sets of three occupancy histograms, oneET-sum histogram, and one additional occupancy histogram. Each histogram has 3564 bins, one for each bunch in the LHC orbit. Each occupancy- histogram bin uses two bytes, and there are four bytes per bin in the ETsum histogram. The baseline design is to add the results from all desirable channels into a single set of histograms. The histograms are transmitted as UDP (User Datagram Protocol) packets from the HLX cards once roughly every 0.37 s, which is safely within the 1.45 s (worst case) histogram over\ufb02ow time. The Ethernet core in the HLX automatically packages the data to make optimal use of net- work bandwidth. Each histogram spans several Ethernet packets, the precise number depending on the type of histogram. The eight sets of histograms comprise about 70 kB of data, which is transmitted at a rate of approximately 1.6 Mbps to an Ethernet switch that aggregates the data from multiple HLX boards. The switch multi-casts the data to a pair of luminosity server nodes. One of the servers is responsible for publishing the luminosity information to various clients, such as the CMS and LHC control rooms and the Fermilab Remote Operations Center (ROC). The second server archives the data for each luminosity section (one luminosity section corresponds to 220or- bits, or about 93 s). An XDAQ layer on this server makes it possible to communicate with other CMS DAQ systems. \u2013 155 \u2013 2008 JINST 3 S08004Chapter 6 Forward detectors 6.1 CASTOR The CASTOR (Centauro And Strange Object Research)"}

Introduction The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics [1\u20134] has been tested by many experimentsover the last four decades and has been shown to successfully describe high energy particle interactions. However, the mecha- nism that breaks electroweak symmetry in the SM has not been veri\ufb01ed experimentally. This mechanism [5\u2013 10], which gives mass to massive elementary particles, impliesthe existence of a scalar particle, the SM Higgs boson.

Since the e\u00b5channel provides most of the sensitivity of the search, only this \ufb01nal state is used in the anal- ysis of the 8TeV data. The kinematic region in which a SM Higgs boson with a mass between 110 GeV and 140 GeV is searched for was kept blinded during the analysis optimisation, until satisfactory agreement was found between the observed and predicted numbers of events in control samples dominated by the principal backgrounds. This Letter is organised as follows. The ATLAS de- tector is brie\ufb02y described in Section 2. The simula- tionsamples andthe signal predictionsare presentedin Section 3. The analyses of the H\u2192ZZ(\u2217)\u21924\u2113,H\u2192\u03b3\u03b3 andH\u2192WW(\u2217)\u2192e\u03bd\u00b5\u03bdchannels are described in Sec- tions 4\u20136, respectively. The statistical procedure used to analyse the results is summarised in Section 7. The systematic uncertainties which are correlated between datasetsandsearchchannelsaredescribedinSection8.

The ATLAS detector TheATLASdetector[19\u201321]isamultipurposeparti- cle physics apparatus with forward-backward symmet- ric cylindrical geometry.

Theelectromagnetic calorimeter is divided into a central barrel (pseudora- pidity2|\u03b7|<1.475) and end-cap regions on either end of the detector (1 .375<|\u03b7|<2.5 for the outer wheel and 2.5<|\u03b7|<3.2 for the inner wheel).

Signal and background simulation samples The SM Higgs boson production processes con- sidered in this analysis are the dominant gluon fu- sion ( gg\u2192H, denoted ggF), vector-boson fusion (qq\u2032\u2192qq\u2032H, denoted VBF) and Higgs-strahlung (qq\u2032\u2192WH,ZH, denoted WH/ZH). The small con- tribution from the associated production with a ttpair (q\u00afq/gg\u2192t\u00aftH, denoted t\u00aftH) is taken into account only inthe H\u2192\u03b3\u03b3analysis. For the ggF process, the signal cross section is com- puted at up to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in QCD [22\u201328]. Next-to-leading order (NLO) elec- troweak (EW) corrections are applied [29, 30], as well asQCDsoft-gluonre-summationsatuptonext-to-next- to-leading logarithm (NNLL) [31]. These calculations, which are described in Refs. [32\u201335], assume factori- sation between QCD and EW corrections. The trans- verse momentum, pT, spectrum of the Higgs boson in theggFprocessfollowsthe HqTcalculation[36],which includesQCD correctionsat NLO and QCD"}

The largest background comes from continuum (Z(\u2217)/\u03b3\u2217)(Z(\u2217)/\u03b3\u2217) production, referred to hereafter as ZZ(\u2217). For low masses there are also important back- ground contributions from Z+jets and t\u00aftproduction, where charged lepton candidates arise either from de- caysofhadronswith b-orc-quarkcontentorfrommis- identi\ufb01cationofjets.

Muon candidates are formed by matching recon- structed ID tracks with either a complete track or a track-segmentreconstructedin the MS [84]. The muon acceptance is extended with respect to Ref. [83] us- ing tracks reconstructed in the forward region of the MS (2.5<|\u03b7|<2.7), which is outside the ID cov- erage. If both an ID and a complete MS track are present,thetwoindependentmomentummeasurements are combined; otherwise the information of the ID or the MS is used alone. Electron candidates must have a well-reconstructed ID track pointing to an electromag- netic calorimeter cluster and the cluster should satisfy a set of identi\ufb01cation criteria [85] that require the lon- gitudinal and transverse shower pro\ufb01les to be consis- tent with those expected for electromagnetic showers. Tracks associated with electromagnetic clusters are \ufb01t- ted using a Gaussian-Sum Filter [86], which allows for bremsstrahlungenergylosses tobetakenintoaccount. Each electron (muon) must satisfy pT>7 GeV (pT>6 GeV) and be measured in the pseudorapidity range|\u03b7|<2.47 (|\u03b7|<2.7).

The most energeticlepton in the quadruplet must satisfy pT>20 GeV, and the second (third) lepton in pTorder must satisfy pT>15 GeV (pT>10 GeV).

Its invariant mass, m34, is required to be in the range mmin<m34<115 GeV, where the value ofmmindepends on the reconstructed four-lepton in- variant mass, m4\u2113. The value of mminvaries monoton- ically from 17 .5 GeV at m4\u2113=120 GeV to 50 GeV atm4\u2113=190 GeV [87] and is constant above this value.

This is requiredto be less than 3.5 (6.5) formuons(electrons). Theelectronimpactparameteris a\ufb00ected by bremsstrahlung and thus has a broader dis- tribution. In addition, leptons must satisfy isolation require- ments based on tracking and calorimetric information.

Systematic uncertainties The uncertainties on the integrated luminosities are determined to be 1.8% for the 7 TeV data and 3.6% for the 8 TeV data using the techniques described in Ref.[92]. The uncertainties on the lepton reconstruction and identi\ufb01cation e\ufb03ciencies and on the momentum scale and resolution are determined using samples of W, Zand J/\u03c8decays [84, 85]. The relative uncertainty on the signal acceptance due to the uncertainty on the muon reconstruction and identi\ufb01cation e \ufb03ciency is \u00b10.7% (\u00b10.5%/\u00b10.5%) for the 4 \u00b5(2e2\u00b5/2\u00b52e) chan- nel for m4\u2113=600 GeV and increases to \u00b10.9% (\u00b10.8%/\u00b10.5%) for m4\u2113=115 GeV.

The dominant background is SM diphoton production ( \u03b3\u03b3); contributions also come from\u03b3+jet and jet+jet production with one or two jets mis-identi\ufb01edasphotons( \u03b3jandj j)andfromtheDrell- Yanprocess. The7 TeVdatahavebeenre-analysedand the results combined with those from the 8TeV data. Among other changes to the analysis, a new category of events with two jets is introduced, which enhancesthe sensitivity to the VBF process. Higgs boson events produced by the VBF process have two forward jets, originating from the two scattered quarks, and tend to be devoidof jets in the central region. Overall,the sen- sitivityoftheanalysishasbeenimprovedbyabout20% withrespectto thatdescribedinRef.[95]. 5.1. Event selection The data used in this channel are selected using a diphoton trigger [96], which requires two clusters formed from energy depositions in the electromagnetic calorimeter. An ETthreshold of 20GeV is applied to each cluster for the 7TeV data, while for the 8 TeV datathethresholdsareincreasedto35GeVonthelead- ing (the highest ET) cluster and to 25GeV on the sub- leading (the next-highest ET) cluster.

For the 8TeVdata,cut-basedcriteriaareusedtoensurereliable photon performance for recently-recorded data.

Systematic uncertainties Hereafter, in cases where two uncertainties are quoted, they refer to the 7TeV and 8 TeV data, respec- tively. The dominant experimental uncertainty on the signal yield (\u00b18%,\u00b111%) comes from the photon re- construction and identi\ufb01cation e \ufb03ciency, which is es- timated with data using electrons from Zdecays and photons from Z\u2192\u2113+\u2113\u2212\u03b3events. Pile-up modelling also a\ufb00ects the expected yields and contributes to the uncertainty (\u00b14%). Further uncertainties on the sig- nal yield are related to the trigger ( \u00b11%), photonisola- tion (\u00b10.4%,\u00b10.5%) and luminosity ( \u00b11.8%,\u00b13.6%). Uncertainties due to the modelling of the underlying event are\u00b16% for VBF and\u00b130% for other produc- tionprocessesinthe2-jetcategory. Uncertaintiesonthe predicted cross sections and branching ratio are sum- marisedin Section8. The uncertainty on the expected fractions of signal events in each category is described in the following.

The signal strength is al- lowed to vary independently in the two channels, al- though the result is essentially unchanged when re- stricted to the SM hypothesis \u00b5=1. The leading sources of systematic uncertainty come from the elec- tron and photon energy scales and resolutions. The re- sulting estimate for the mass of the observedparticle is 126.0\u00b10.4 (stat)\u00b10.4 (sys)GeV. The best-\ufb01t signal strength \u02c6 \u00b5is shownin Fig. 7(c) as a function of mH. The observed excess corresponds to \u02c6\u00b5=1.4\u00b10.3 for mH=126GeV, which is consistent with the SM Higgs boson hypothesis \u00b5=1. A sum- mary of the individual and combined best-\ufb01t values of the strength parameter for a SM Higgs boson mass hy- pothesis of 126GeV is shown in Fig. 10, while more information about the three main channels is provided inTable7.

Sincethen,theanalysisofdatacollectedatcentre-of-massenergiesof7TeV, 8TeV and 13TeV in Runs 1 and 2 of the LHC has led to the observation of many of the production modes and decay channels predicted by the Standard Model (SM). The bosonic decay channels are well established and have entered an era of precision measurements [8\u201318]. The decay into -lepton pairs was \ufb01rst observed in the combination of the ATLAS and CMS analyses [19, 20]. The main Higgs boson production modes, gluon\u2013gluon fusion (ggF) and vector-boson fusion (VBF), were already measured following the analysis of the Run 1 data, and recently the coupling of the Higgs boson to top quarks was directly observed by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations [21, 22] through the observation of the associated production of a Higgs boson and a top-quark pair ( t\u00aftH). ThedominantdecayoftheSMHiggsbosonisintopairsof b-quarks,withanexpectedbranchingfraction of approximately 58% for a mass of mH=125GeV [23]. However, large backgrounds from multi- jet production make a search in the dominant gluon\u2013gluon fusion production mode very challenging at hadron colliders.

Searches in this channel at the Tevatron by the CDF and D0 Collaborations showed an excess of events with a signi\ufb01cance of 2.8 standard deviations for a Higgs boson with a mass of 125GeV [28]. Analysing the 2015 and 2016 data and combining with the Run 1 results [29, 30], both the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations reported evidence for Higgs boson production and decay in this channel, with observed (expected)signi\ufb01cancesof3.6(4.0)and3.8(3.8)standarddeviations,respectively[31,32]. Searchesfor H!b\u00afbdecays have also been conducted in the VBF [33\u201335] and t\u00aftH[36\u201341] channels, and with high transverse momentum Higgs bosons [42], but with markedly lower sensitivities. This Letter reports an update to the search for the SM Higgs boson decaying into a b\u00afbpair in the VH production mode with the ATLAS detector in Run 2 of the LHC presented in Ref. [31]. This update uses 79.8 fb\u00001ofppcollision data collected at a centre-of-mass energy of 13TeV, to be compared with 36.1 fb\u00001for the previous result. In addition, an updated version of the ATLAS reconstruction code and improvedobjectcalibrationsareused,theimpactoftheluminosityandmodellingsystematicuncertainties are reduced from updated measurements and estimates, and larger samples of simulated events are used to model the background processes.

An observation of the b\u00afbdecay of the Higgs boson by the CMS Collaboration [43] was submitted for publication at the same time as this Letter. 2 The ATLAS detector ATLAS [44] is a general-purpose particle detector covering nearly the entire solid angle 1around the collision point. An inner tracking detector, located within a 2 T axial magnetic \ufb01eld generated by a thin superconducting solenoid, is used to measure the trajectories and momenta of charged particles. The inner layers consist of high-granularity silicon pixel detectors covering a pseudorapidity range j\u0011j<2:5, and include an innermost layer [45, 46] that was added to the detector between Run 1 and Run 2. Silicon microstrip detectors covering j\u0011j<2:5are located beyond the pixel detectors. Outside the microstrip detectors and covering j\u0011j<2:0, there are straw-tube tracking detectors, which also provide measurements of transition radiation that are used in electron identi\ufb01cation.

Several uncertainties are considered, uncorrelated between the electron and muon sub-channels. The respective variations are added in quadrature for the normalisations, or considered as separate shape uncertainties. Variations are obtained by changing the de\ufb01nition of the multi-jetcontrolregion(morestringentisolationrequirements,adi\ufb00erentsingle-electrontriggertoprobe apotentialtriggerbiasintheisolationrequirements),andvaryingthenormalisationofthecontamination from the top ( t\u00aftandWt) and V+jetsprocesses in the multi-jet control region. In addition, the following systematic uncertainties have an impact only on the multi-jet normalisation: use of another discriminant variable instead of mW Tfor the template \ufb01t (the azimuthal separation between the directions of the lepton transversemomentumandthevectorialsumofthemomentaofthetwoorthreejets)and,fortheelectron sub-channel only, the inclusion of the Emiss T<30GeV region, which signi\ufb01cantly enhances the multi-jet contribution in the template \ufb01t. 6 Statistical analysis The statistical procedure is based on a likelihood function L\u00b9\u0016;\u0012\u00ba, constructed as the product of Poisson probability terms over the bins of the input distributions.

The inner tracking detector covers the pseudorapidity 1ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the centre of the detector and the \ud835\udc67-axis along the beam pipe. The \ud835\udc65-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the \ud835\udc66-axis points upwards. Cylindrical coordinates (\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udf19)are used in the transverse plane, \ud835\udf19being the azimuthal angle around the \ud835\udc67-axis. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle \ud835\udf03as\ud835\udf02=\u2212ln tan(\ud835\udf03/2).

The field integral of the toroids ranges between 2.0and6.0Tmacross most of the detector. The muon spectrometer includes a system of precision chambers for tracking and fast detectors for triggering. A two-level trigger system is used to select events. The first-level trigger is implemented in hardware and uses a subset of the detector information to accept events at a rate below 100kHz. This is followed by a software-based trigger that reduces the accepted event rate to 1kHzon average depending on the data-taking conditions. An extensive softwaresuite [16]is used indata simulation, inthe reconstructionand analysis ofreal and simulated data, in detector operations, and in the trigger and data acquisition systems of the experiment. 3 Data and simulation samples 3.1 Data Themeasurementusesthefull \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5dcollisiondatasetcollectedat\u221a\ud835\udc60=13TeVbytheATLASdetectorduring Run 2 of the LHC.

The Higgs boson width\u0393in all signal samples was set to the SM prediction for \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc3b=125GeV,\u0393=4.07MeV, which is much narrower than the experimental resolution.

The main differences are the use of an updated photon energy calibration [14] with reduced systematic uncertainties, and the classification of events into categories that are optimised to minimise the uncertainty in the measured Higgs boson mass rather than in the Higgs boson production cross-sections. Comparedwiththepreviousmassmeasurement[10],whichusedphotoncandidatesreconstructedfrom afixed-sizeclusterofenergydepositsintheelectromagneticcalorimeteridentifiedbyasliding-window algorithm,thismeasurementreliesonphotoncandidatesthatarereconstructedfromdynamic,variable-size clusters,calledsuperclusters.

Besides its mass, its width \u2014 related to its lifetime \u2014 is an important parameter. One way to determine this quantity is by measuring its off-shell produc- tion, where the Higgs boson mass is far away from its nominal value, and relating it to its on-shell production, where the mass is close to the nominal value. Here, we re- port evidence for such off-shell contributions to the production cross section of two Z bosons with data from the CMS experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. We constrain the total rate of the off-shell Higgs boson contribution beyond the Z boson pair production threshold, relative to its standard model expectation, to the interval [0.0061, 2.0 ]at 95% con\ufb01dence level. The scenario with no off-shell contribution is ex- cluded at a p-value of 0.0003 (3.6 standard deviations). We measure the width of the Higgs boson as GH=3.2+2.4 \u00001.7MeV, in agreement with the standard model expectation of 4.1 MeV. In addition, we set constraints on anomalous Higgs boson couplings to W and Z boson pairs.

This \ufb01eld, known as the Higgs \ufb01eld [1\u20133], interacts with SM particles, giving them mass, as well as with itself. The \ufb01eld carrier is a massive, scalar (spin-0) particle known as the Higgs (H) boson. Nearly half a century after its postulation, it was \ufb01nally observed in 2012 with a mass mHof around 125 GeV by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations [4\u2013 6] at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Given the unique role the H boson plays in the SM, studies of its properties are a major goal of particle physics. Apart from mass, another important property of a particle is its lifetime t. Only a few funda- mental particles are stable; others\u2014including the H boson\u2014exist only for a \ufb02eeting moment before disintegrating into other, lighter, species. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle [7] pro- vides a direct connection between the lifetime of a particle and the uncertainty in its mass, a property known as the particle\u2019s width, G. Any unstable particle (often referred to as a res- onance ) has a \ufb01nite lifetime, with shorter tcorresponding to broader G. The two quantities are related through the Planck constant, h, asG=h/(2pt). Even with perfect experimental resolution, the observed mass of an unstable particle will not be constant across a series of mea- surements (e.g., of the invariant mass of its decay products i, which is calculated from the sums of their energies, Ei, and momenta, ~pi, asp (\u00e5iEi)2\u0000j\u00e5i~pij2). The possible mass values are distributed according to a characteristic relativistic Breit\u2013Wigner distribution [8] with a nomi- nal mass value corresponding to the maximum of the Breit\u2013Wigner, and with width parameter G. Particles are understood to be on"}
{"source": "2202.06923v2.pdf", "text": "the mass shell (on-shell) if their mass is close to the nominal mass value, and off-shell if their mass takes a value far away from it. By the aforementioned property of the Breit\u2013Wigner line shape, particles are generally more likely to be produced on- shell than off-shell when energy and momentum conservation allows it. Scattering amplitudes (A) for off-shell particle production, followed by a speci\ufb01c decay \ufb01nal state, may be modi\ufb01ed further by interference with other processes, which is large and destructive in the case of the H boson. In this speci\ufb01c case, writing A =H+C, with H standing for the H boson contribu- tion and C for other interfering contributions, we will use the term \u201coff-shell production\u201d as a shorthand for the jHj2term injAj2. For broad resonances, the width can be obtained by directly measuring the Breit\u2013Wigner line shape, e.g., as was done in the case of the Z boson, measured to have a mass of mZ=91.188\u0006 0.002 GeV and a width of GZ=2.495\u00060.002 GeV at the CERN Large Electron Positron col- lider [9]. The H boson is expected to live three orders of magnitude longer, with a theoretically predicted width of GH=4.1 MeV (0.0041 GeV) [10], and a deviation from the SM prediction would indicate the existence of new physics. This width is too small to be measured directly from the line shape because of the limited mass resolution of order 1 GeV achievable with the present LHC detectors. Another direct way of measuring the H boson width would be to mea- sure its lifetime by means of its decay length and use the relationship GH=h/(2ptH), but its lifetime is still too short ( tH=1.6\u000210\u000022s) to be detectable directly. The present experimental limit on this quantity is tH<1.9\u000210\u000013s at 95% con\ufb01dence level (CL) [11], nine orders of magnitude"}

In the decay of an H boson with mH\u0019125 GeV 2 to a pair of massive gauge bosons V (V =W or Z, with masses around 80.4 or 91.2 GeV, respectively), we have mV<mH<2mV. Therefore, when the H boson is produced on-shell (with the VV invariant mass mVV\u0018mH), one of the V bosons must be off-shell to satisfy four- momentum conservation. Once the H boson is produced off-shell with large enough invariant mass mVV>2mV(off-shell H boson production region), the V bosons themselves are produced on-shell. Since the Breit\u2013Wigner mass distribution of either the H or V boson maximizes at their respective nominal masses, the rate of off-shell H boson production above the V boson pair production threshold is enhanced with respect to what one would expect from the Breit\u2013 Wigner line shape of the H boson alone. The measurement of the higher part of the mVVspectrum can then be used to establish off-shell H boson production. The ratio of off-shell to on-shell production rates allows for a measure- ment of GH[12, 13] via the cross section proportionality relations son-shell\u00b5g2 pg2 d GH\u00b5mp)soff-shell\u00b5g2 pg2 d\u00b5mpGH, where gpand gdare the couplings associated with the H boson production and decay modes, respectively, and mpis the on-shell H boson signal strength in the production mode being con- sidered. Each signal strength is de\ufb01ned as the ratio of the H boson squared amplitude in the measured cross section to that predicted in the SM. The off-shell H boson signal strength, moff-shell p , can be expressed as mpGHin each production mode, and the scenario with no off-shell production becomes equivalent to the limiting case GH=0.

The CMS and ATLAS Collaborations have previously used this method to set upper limits on GHas low as 9.2 MeV at 95% CL [14, 15]. It is important to distinguish between two types of H boson production modes: the gluon fusion gg!H!ZZ process, where the H boson is produced via its couplings to fermions, and the EW processes, which involve HVV (i.e., HWW or HZZ) couplings. The top row of Fig. 1 shows the Feynman diagrams for the most dominant contributions to the gg (top left) process, and the EW processes of vector boson fusion (VBF, top center) and VH (top right). A more complete set of diagrams for the EW process are shown in Extended Data Figs. 1 and 2. Because different H boson couplings are involved in the gg and EW processes, we extract two off-shell signal strength parameters moff-shell Ffor the gg mode and moff-shell Vfor the EW mode. We also consider an overall off-shell signal strength parameter moff-shellwith different assumptions on the ratio Roff-shell V,F=moff-shell V/moff-shell F. A major challenge arises from the fact that there are other sources of ZZ pairs in the SM (con- tinuum ZZ production), see for example the bottom row of Fig. 1. These contributions, par- ticularly those from q q!ZZ, are typically much larger than the contribution from off-shell H!ZZ. In addition, some of the amplitudes from continuum ZZ processes interfere with the H boson amplitudes because they share the same initial and \ufb01nal states.

Other backgrounds from q q!ZZ, q q0!WZ with W!`nand an undetected lepton, and the small contribution from tZ production are estimated from simulation. A third CR of trilepton events, consisting mostly of q q0!WZ events, is used to constrain the q q0!WZ background and, most importantly, the large q q!ZZ background. The ability to constrain qq!ZZ from q q0!WZ is based on the similarity in the physics of these processes.

These discriminants are the DVBF 2jet-type kinematic discriminants used in Refs. [15, 23], and are based on the four-momenta of the H boson and the two jets leading in pT. Data interpretation The results for the off-shell signal strength parameters moff-shell F,moff-shell V, and moff-shell, and the H boson width GHare extracted from binned extended maximum likelihood \ufb01ts over several kinematic distributions following the parametrization in Ref.

Nosigni\ufb01cantdeviationsfromtheStandardModel (SM) predictions were found. A probe of fundamental interest to further explore the nature of the Higgs boson is its coupling to the top quark, the heaviest particle in the SM. Indirect measurements of the Yukawa coupling between the Higgs boson and the top quark were made by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations [3], assuming no contribution from unknown particles in the gluon\u2013gluon fusion (ggF) loop. A more direct test of this coupling can be performed through the production of the Higgs boson in associationwithatopquarkpair, t\u00aftH. Usingaproton\u2013proton( pp)datasetcorrespondingtoanintegrated luminosity of 36.1 \u00060.8 fb\u00001[9], at a centre-of-mass energyps=13TeV, evidence of this production mode was found"}

Combining data at 7, 8, and 13 TeV, the CMS Collaboration reported an observed (expected) signi\ufb01cance of 5.2 (4.2) standard deviations [11]. This Letter presents results of the search for the t\u00aftHprocess and the measurement of the t\u00aftHproduction cross section using data produced in ppcollisions by the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and recorded with the ATLAS detector. The ATLAS detector is described in detail in Refs. [12, 13]. Compared to Ref. [10], the H! andH!Z Z\u0003!4`(`=e;\u0016) analyses are updated with the 13 TeV data collected in 2017. Improved lepton and photon reconstruction algorithms [14] and analysis techniques are used. The updated analyses are combined with the H!b\u00afband multilepton analyses from Refs. [10, 15], the latter targeting Higgs boson decays into WW\u0003,H! + \u0000with hadronically and leptonically decaying -leptons, and H!Z Z\u0003without Z Z\u0003!4`.

Both photons must satisfy the quality requirements discussed in Ref.

Introduction In 2012, ATLAS and CMS discovered a Higgs boson [1, 2] at the Large Hadron Col- lider(LHC)[3]. ThediscoveryoftheHiggsbosonfilledthelastparticlepredictedbytheStandard Model (SM). At the same time, this discovery opens many questions not solved in the SM. The Higgs sector is the most vulnerable in the SM. 15 parameters out of 19 in the SM are related to the Higgs sector. ATLAS [4] and CMS [5] have measured Higgs boson properties in Run 1, and Run 2. There are several extraordinary achievements during Run2: the observation of the Higgsbosonproductioninassociationwithatopquarks[6,7],theobservationoftheHiggsboson decaying into a pair of bottom quarks [8, 9], the evidence of the interaction between Higgs boson and muon [10, 11], and the evidence of Higgs boson decaying into \u2113\u2113\ud835\udefe[12].

However, they were still the dominant systematic uncertainties for the mass measurement in the previous analysis [14]. ATLAS improves the calibration method of the photon energy scale and resolution, in particu- lar, in-situ calibration using \ud835\udc4d\u2192\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52events providing a significant reduction of the systematic uncertainties [15]. The systematic uncertainty of photon calibration is reduced by a factor of four. The measured Higgs boson mass is 125.17 \u00b10.11(stat.)\u00b10.09(syst.) GeV in Run 2 dataset and 125.22\u00b10.11(stat.)\u00b10.09(syst.) GeV combined with Run 1 dataset [14]. ATLAS combined mass measurement of \ud835\udc3b\u2192\ud835\udefe\ud835\udefewith that of the \ud835\udc3b\u2192\ud835\udc4d\ud835\udc4d\u2217\u21924\u2113which provides another best mass measurement because of the excellent lepton energy and momentum calibration [16]. The mass measurement of two channels and their combinations is summarised in the left of Fig- ure 1. All measurements are in good agreement, and the combined Higgs mass is measured to be 125.11\u00b10.09(stat.)\u00b10.06(syst.) GeV. 3.

Higgs coupling and cross-section measurements The measurements of couplings between the Higgs boson and the SM particles and non- SM particles are one of the most important Higgs properties measurements because many BSM models indicate the deviations from the SM. ATLAS and CMS measure the couplings in various production and decay modes which covers different couplings in the different phase spaces. The combined measurement of all productions and decay modes provides the most sensitive and com- prehensive information on the couplings. Figure 2 shows the results of coupling measurement using\ud835\udf05-framework [21]. ATLAS and CMS have similar precision on the \ud835\udf05parameters, which are coupling strength modifiers normalized by the coupling predicted by the SM. The precision for \ud835\udf05\ud835\udc4a/\ud835\udc4d,\ud835\udf05\ud835\udefe,\ud835\udf05\ud835\udc54,\ud835\udf05\ud835\udf0freaches 6-8% level, \ud835\udf05\ud835\udc61,\ud835\udf05\ud835\udc4fprecision is approximately 10%, \ud835\udf05\ud835\udf07precision is 20% and\ud835\udf05\ud835\udc4d\ud835\udefeprecision is 40% level [22, 23]. ATLAS also shows the limit on the branching fraction of invisible decay ( \ud835\udc35inv.) and other undetected decay ( \ud835\udc35u.)"}

Submitted to Physics Letters BarXiv:1207.7235v2 [hep-ex] 28 Jan 2013 1 1 Introduction The standard model (SM) of elementary particles provides a remarkably accurate description of results from many accelerator and non-accelerator based experiments. The SM comprises quarks and leptons as the building blocks of matter, and describes their interactions through the exchange of force carriers: the photon for electromagnetic interactions, the W and Z bosons for weak interactions, and the gluons for strong interactions. The electromagnetic and weak interactions are uni\ufb01ed in the electroweak theory. Although the predictions of the SM have been extensively con\ufb01rmed, the question of how the W and Z gauge bosons acquire mass whilst the photon remains massless is still"}
{"source": "1207.7235v2.pdf", "text": "open. Nearly \ufb01fty years ago it was proposed [1\u20136] that spontaneous symmetry breaking in gauge theories could be achieved through the introduction of a scalar \ufb01eld. Applying this mechanism to the electroweak theory [7\u20139] through a complex scalar doublet \ufb01eld leads to the generation of the W and Z masses, and to the prediction of the existence of the SM Higgs boson (H). The scalar \ufb01eld also gives mass to the fundamental fermions through the Yukawa interaction. The mass mHof the SM Higgs boson is not predicted by theory. However, general considera- tions [10\u201313] suggest that mHshould be smaller than \u00181 TeV, while precision electroweak mea- surements imply that mH<152 GeV at 95% con\ufb01dence level (CL) [14]. Over the past twenty years, direct searches for the Higgs boson have been carried out at the LEP collider, leading to a lower bound of mH>114.4 GeV at 95% CL [15], and at the Tevatron proton-antiproton col- lider, excluding the mass range 162\u2013166 GeV at 95% CL [16] and detecting an excess of events, recently reported in [17\u201319], in the range 120\u2013135 GeV. The discovery or exclusion of the SM Higgs boson is one of the primary scienti\ufb01c goals of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [20]. Previous direct searches at the LHC were based on data from proton-proton collisions corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 5 fb\u00001collected at a centre-of-mass energyps=7 TeV. The CMS experiment excluded at 95% CL a range of masses from 127 to 600 GeV [21]. The ATLAS experiment excluded at 95% CL the ranges 111.4\u2013116.6, 119.4\u2013122.1 and 129.2\u2013541 GeV [22]. Within the remaining allowed mass region, an excess of events near 125 GeV was reported by both experiments. In 2012 the proton-proton centre-of- mass energy was increased to 8 TeV and by the end of June an additional integrated"}

This paper reports the results of a search for the SM Higgs boson using samples collected by the CMS experiment, comprising data recorded atps=7 and 8 TeV. The search is performed in \ufb01ve decay modes, H !gg, ZZ, W+W\u0000,t+t\u0000, and b b, in the low-mass range from 110 up to 160 GeV. In this mass range the Higgs boson production cross section is predicted to have values between 23 (29) and 10 (14) pb atps=7 (8) TeV [23]. The natural width of the SM Higgs boson over the same range is less than 100 MeV and the width of any observed peak would be entirely dominated by instrumental mass resolution. In what follows, `stands for electrons or muons, H!W+W\u0000is denoted as H!WW, H!t+t\u0000as H!tt, and H!bb as H!bb. For the \ufb01nal states ZZ and WW in the low-mass region, one or more of the Z or W bosons is off mass shell. With respect to the published analyses [24\u201328], most analyses have been re-optimized, incor- porating improvements in reconstruction performance and event selection, and mitigating the more challenging conditions due to the higher LHC intensities in 2012. The new analyses pre- sented herein, of 8 TeV samples, and of 7 TeV samples featuring modi\ufb01ed event selection crite- ria, were performed in a \u201cblind\u201d way: the algorithms and selection procedures were formally approved and \ufb01xed before the results from data in the signal region were examined.

The observed local signi\ufb01cance is 5.0 standard deviations ( s), compared with an expected signi\ufb01cance of 5.8 s. The evidence is strongest in the two \ufb01nal states with the best mass resolution, namely H !ggwith a signi\ufb01cance of 4.1 sand H!ZZ (with the Z bosons decaying to electrons or muons) with a signi\ufb01cance of 3.2 s. The decay to two photons indicates that the new particle is a boson with spin different from one. 2 The CMS experiment The possibility of detection of the SM Higgs boson played a crucial role in the conceptual design of the CMS experiment as a benchmark to test the performance of the detector [29\u201331]. Since the SM Higgs boson mass is not predicted by theory and its production cross section and natural width vary widely over the allowed mass range, a search was envisaged over a large range of masses and in diverse decay modes: pairs of photons, Z bosons, W bosons, tleptons, and b quarks. Planning in view of the analysis of all these channels ensured a detector capable of observing a Higgs boson over a broad mass range and able to detect most potential signals of new physics. The central feature of the CMS apparatus [32] is a superconducting solenoid of 6 m inter- nal diameter, which provides a magnetic \ufb01eld of 3.8 T. Within the \ufb01eld volume are a sili- con pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass/scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL). Muons are measured in gas-ionization detec- tors embedded in the steel \ufb02ux-return yoke. Extensive forward calorimeters complement the coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors.

The jet momentum is determined as the vector sum of all particle momenta in the jet. Jet en- ergy corrections are derived from simulation studies and from in situ measurements using the energy balance of dijet and Z/ g+jet events [41]. These corrections are between 5% and 10% of the true momentum over the entire pTspectrum and detector acceptance. The jet momentum resolution achieved is s(pT)/pT=85%/p pT/GeV\b4% for central jets. A selection is applied to separate jets originating in the primary interaction from those due to energy deposits as- sociated with pileup. The discrimination is based on the differences in the jet shapes, in the relative multiplicity of charged and neutral components, and in the fraction of transverse mo- mentum carried by the hardest components. Within the tracker acceptance the jet tracks are also required to be consistent with originating at the primary vertex. The missing transverse energy vector is taken as the negative vector sum of all particle trans- verse momenta, and its magnitude is referred to as Emiss T. The typical missing transverse energy resolution is around 0.5pSETGeV [42], where SETis the scalar sum of all particle transverse momenta in GeV. The energy deposited in the ECAL is clustered both with general clustering algorithms [43] and with algorithms that constrain the clusters in handfto the shapes expected from electrons and photons with high pT[44].

In the 7 TeV data set, the dielectron mass resolution at the Z boson mass is 1.56 GeV in the barrel and 2.57 GeV in the endcaps, while in the 8 TeV sample, reconstructed with preliminary calibration constants, the corresponding values are 1.61 and 3.75 GeV. For electrons, the reconstruction combines the clusters in the ECAL and the trajectory in the silicon tracker [45]. Trajectories in the tracker volume are reconstructed using a model of electron energy loss and \ufb01tted with a Gaussian sum \ufb01lter [46]. The electron momentum is determined from the combination of ECAL and tracker measurements. Muon candidates are reconstructed with two algorithms, one in which the tracks in the silicon detector are matched to segments in the muon chambers, and another in which a combined \ufb01t is performed to the signals found in both the silicon tracker and muon systems [43].

The uncertainties in the luminosity measurements are 2.2% and 4.4% for the 7 TeV and 8 TeV data sets, respectively. 4 Searches for the standard model Higgs boson Initial phenomenological discussions of Higgs boson production and decay can be found in Refs. [49\u201356]. Four main mechanisms are predicted for Higgs boson production in pp colli- sions: the gluon-gluon fusion mechanism, which has the largest cross section, followed in turn by vector-boson fusion (VBF), associated WH and ZH production (VH), and production in as- sociation with top quarks (t tH). The cross sections for the individual production mechanisms and the decay branching fractions, together with their uncertainties, have been computed fol- lowing Refs. [57\u2013101] and are compiled in Refs. [23, 102]. The particular set of sensitive decay modes of the SM Higgs boson depends strongly on mH. The results presented in this paper are based on the \ufb01ve most sensitive decay modes in the low-mass region: H !gg; H!ZZ followed by ZZ decays to 4 `; H!WW followed by decays to 2 `2n; H!ttfollowed by at least one leptonic tdecay; and H!bb followed by b-quark fragmentation into jets. This list is presented in Table 1 and comprises the full set of decay modes and subchannels, or categories, for which both the 7 and 8 TeV data sets have been analysed.

Samples of MC events used to represent signal and background are fully simulated using GEANT 4 [103]. The simulations include pileup interactions matching the distribution of the number of such interactions observed in data. The description of the Higgs boson signal is obtained from MC simulation using, for most of the decay modes and production processes, the next-to-leading-order (NLO) matrix-element generator POWHEG [104, 105], interfaced with PYTHIA 6.4 [106].

To enhance the sensitivity of the analysis, candidate diphoton events are separated into mutu- ally exclusive categories of different expected signal-to-background ratios, based on the prop- erties of the reconstructed photons and on the presence of two jets satisfying criteria aimed at selecting events in which a Higgs boson is produced through the VBF process. The analysis uses multivariate techniques for the selection and classi\ufb01cation of the events. As an indepen- dent cross-check, an analysis is also performed that is almost identical to the one described in Ref. [24], using simpler criteria based on the properties of the reconstructed photons to select and classify events. The multivariate analysis achieves 15% higher sensitivity than the cross- check analysis. The reconstructed primary vertex that most probably corresponds to the interaction vertex of the diphoton candidate is identi\ufb01ed using the kinematic properties of the tracks associated with that vertex and their correlation with the diphoton kinematics.

In the \ufb01rst approach, the additional pair of leptons is required to have the same charge (to avoid signal contamination) while in the second, two opposite-charge leptons failing the isolation and identi\ufb01cation criteria are required.

The analysis is therefore designed to search for the associated production of the Higgs boson in events where a dijet resonance is produced at high pTin association with a W or Z boson; this largely suppresses the QCD background. Five independent search channels are explored corresponding to different decays of the vector boson: Z (``)H, Z(nn)H, and W (`n)H. Events are further separated into two categories based on the pTof the vector boson, ranging from 50\u2013100 GeV for the lowest bin in the Z (``)search, to greater than 170 GeV for the highest bin in the W (`n)search. For the Z (nn)search, two subchannels are de\ufb01ned as 120 <Emiss T<160 GeV andEmiss T>160 GeV. The two jets comprising the candidate Higgs boson decay are required to be identi\ufb01ed as b jets, and the dijet system must satisfy a pTthreshold"}

Dominant backgrounds arise from production of vector bosons in association with jets, pair- or single-production of top quarks, and diboson production (WW, WZ, ZZ) with one of the bosons decaying hadronically. Signi\ufb01cant background rejection is achieved in general by requiring large pTfor the dijet, while also requiring that there be minimal additional jet activity and that the vector boson and dijet be back to back in azimuth. The effect on the signal ef\ufb01ciency of this selection due to higher-order electroweak [133] and QCD [91] corrections are accounted for in the systematic uncertainties. Further signal discrimination is obtained from the dijet invariant mass, which is expected to peak near mH.

The combined 68% CL contour shown in Fig. 17 assumes that the relative event yields among the three channels are those expected from the standard model, while the overall signal strength is a free parameter. To extract the value of mXin a model-independent way, the signal yields of the three channels are allowed to vary independently.

The search is performed in \ufb01ve decay modes: gg, ZZ, W+W\u0000,t+t\u0000, and b b. An excess of events is observed above the expected background, with a local signi\ufb01cance of 5.0 s, at a mass near 125 GeV, signalling the production of a new particle. The expected local signi\ufb01cance for a standard model Higgs boson of that mass is 5.8 s. The global p-value in the search range of 115\u2013130 (110\u2013145) GeV corresponds to 4.6 s(4.5s). The excess is most signi\ufb01cant in the two decay modes with the best mass resolution, ggand ZZ, and a \ufb01t to these signals gives a mass of 125.3\u00060.4(stat.)\u00060.5(syst.)GeV. The decay to two photons indicates that the new parti- cle is a boson with spin different from one. The results presented here are consistent, within uncertainties, with expectations for a standard model Higgs boson.

The de\ufb01nitions of the production bins used for this measurement are shown in the left panel of Fig- ure 1 (shaded area). All production bins are de\ufb01ned for Higgs bosons with rapidity j\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc3bj\u009f2.5 and no 3 requirement is placed on the particle-level leptons. Two sets of production bins with di\ufb00erent granularity are considered, as a trade-o\ufb00 between statistical and theoretical uncertainties. The \ufb01rst set of production bins (Production Mode Stage) [24] is de\ufb01ned according to the Higgs boson production modes: gluon\u2013gluon fusion ( ggF), vector-boson fusion ( VBF) and associated production with vector bosons ( VH, where\ud835\udc49=\ud835\udc4aor\ud835\udc4d) or top quark pairs ( \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3b). Since\ud835\udc4f-jets from\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc3bassociated production are emitted at small angles relative to the beam axis and usually outside of the detector acceptance, the \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc3bandggFHiggs boson production modes have similar signatures and acceptances. Their contributions are considered together with their relative ratio \ufb01xed to the SM prediction. In the following, the sum of their contributions is referred to as ggF. Similarly, single top production ( tH) is considered together with \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3b, with their relative ratio \ufb01xed to the SM prediction. In contrast to the Stage-0 production bins described in Ref. [24], the VHevents with hadronic decays of the vector boson \ud835\udc49are includedinthe VHproductionbinratherthaninthe ggForVBFbins.

The de\ufb01nitions of the bins are based on the multiplicity of particle-level jets, the Higgs boson transverse momentum \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc3b Tand the invariant mass \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57of the two jets with the highest transverse momentum. Particle-level jets are built from all stable particles (particles with lifetime c \ud835\udf0f \u00a110 mm) including neutrinos, photons, and leptons from hadron decays or those produced in the parton shower. The anti-\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc61jet reconstruction algorithm [26, 27] with a radius parameter \ud835\udc45=0\u00954is used. All Higgs boson decay products, as well as the leptons and neutrinos from the decays of the associated \ud835\udc49bosons are excluded from the jet building, while the decay products from hadronically decaying associated \ud835\udc49bosons, are included.

For \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc3b Tbelow 200 GeV, further splits are made according to the jet multiplicity and \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc3b T. Events with no jets are split into two bins with \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc3b Tbelow and above 10 GeV. Events with one jet are split into three bins with \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc3b Tbelow 60 GeV, between 60 GeVand 120GeV, and above 120GeV. Finally, Higgs boson events with two or more jets are combined into one bin.

It consists of silicon pixel, silicon microstrip, and transition radiation tracking detectors.

The calorimeters are surrounded by the MS and three large air-core toroidal superconducting magnets with eight coils each. The \ufb01eld integral of the toroid magnets ranges between 2.0and6.0Tm across most of the detector. The MS includes a system of precision tracking chambers and fast detectors for triggering, covering the region j\ud835\udf02j\u009f2\u00957. Events are selected using a \ufb01rst-level trigger implemented in custom electronics, which reduces the event rate to a maximum of 100kHz using a subset of detector information. Softwarealgorithmswithaccesstothefulldetectorinformationarethenusedinthehigh-level trigger to yield a recorded event rate of about 1 kHz [35]. 1ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the centre of the detector and the\ud835\udc67-axis along the beam pipe. The \ud835\udc65-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the \ud835\udc66-axis points upwards.

[17, 128]. Proton\u2013proton collision vertices are constructed from reconstructed trajectories of charged particles in the ID with transverse momentum \ud835\udc5dT\u00a1500MeV. Events are required to have at least one collision vertex with at least two associated tracks.

Electron candidates are reconstructed from energy clusters in the electromagnetic calorimeter that are matched to ID tracks [129].

Events were triggered by a combination ofsingle-lepton,dileptonandtrileptontriggerswithdi\ufb00erenttransversemomentumthresholds. Single- lepton triggers with the lowest thresholds had strict identi\ufb01cation and isolation requirements. Both the high-thresholdsingle-leptontriggersandthemultileptontriggershadlooserselectioncriteria. Duetoan increasing peak luminosity, these thresholds increased slightlyduring the data-taking periods [142, 143]. For single-muon triggers, the \ud835\udc5dTthreshold ranged from between 20 and 26 GeV, while for single-electron triggers,the\ud835\udc5dTthresholdrangedfrom24to26 GeV. Theglobaltriggere\ufb03ciencyforsignaleventspassing the \ufb01nal selection is about 98%.

The sources of uncertainty in these expectations are detailed in Section 7. The signal composition in terms of the Reduced Stage-1.1 production bins is shown in Figure 3. The separation of the contributions from di\ufb00erent production bins, such as the gg2H-2\ud835\udc57,qq2Hqq-\ud835\udc49\ud835\udc3b andqq2Hqq-VBFcomponents contributing in categories with two or more jets, is improved by means of discriminants obtained using multivariate data analysis, as described in the following section. 5.2 Multivariate production mode discriminants To further increase the sensitivity of the cross-section measurements in the production bins (Section 1.1), multivariate discriminants using neural networks (NNs) [148] are"}

In categories with three targeted processes, only two of the three corresponding output probabilities are independent.

While for the previous analyses [17, 128], simulation was exclusively used to estimate both the shape and normalisation, in this analysis the normalisation is constrained by a data-driven technique. This allows the systematic uncertainty to be reduced by removing both the theoretical and luminosity uncertainties contributing to the normalisation uncertainty. As outlined in Section 5.1, to estimate the normalisation, sideband categories in the \ud835\udc5a4\u2113mass region 105\u2013115GeVand 130\u2013160 GeVare de\ufb01ned according to the jet multiplicity (SB- 0\ud835\udc57, SB- 1\ud835\udc57, SB- 2\ud835\udc57). The normalisation of the \ud835\udc4d\ud835\udc4d\u0003background is simultaneously \ufb01tted with a common normalisation factor for signal region and sideband categories with the same jet multiplicity. For example, the \ud835\udc4d\ud835\udc4d\u0003background is scaledbya commonfactorfor 2\ud835\udc57,2\ud835\udc57-BSM-likeandSB- 2\ud835\udc57categories. Thebackground shapetemplates forNNdiscriminants and the expected fraction of events in relevant reconstructed signal-region event categories are obtained from simulation. As shown in Figure 4(a), good agreement is found between data and simulation for the shape of the NN observable. All expected distributions are shown after the \ufb01nal \ufb01t to the data for the Production Mode measurement (see Section 8) and are referred to as post-\ufb01t distributionsinthefollowing.

The estimation of the \ud835\udc4d\ud835\udc4d\u0003process in the jet multiplicity bins removes one of the leading theoretical uncertainties [155]. Due to the limited sensitivity and the low expected yield, the normalisation of\ud835\udc4d\ud835\udc4d\u0003in\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3b-like categories is estimated from simulation.

The impact of the theory systematic uncertainties on the signal depends on the kind of measurement that is performed. Forsignal-strengthmeasurements,de\ufb01nedasthemeasuredcross-sectiondividedbytheSM prediction,orinterpretationofcross-sectionusingtheEFTapproach,eachsourceoftheoryuncertainty a\ufb00ects both the acceptance and the predicted SM cross-section. For the cross-section measurements, only e\ufb00ects on the acceptance need to be considered. The impact of the theory systematic uncertainties on the background depends on the method of estimating the normalisation. If simulation is used, the uncertainties in the acceptance and the predicted SM cross-sectionareincluded. Ifthenormalisationisestimatedfromadata-drivenmethod,onlytheimpacton the relative event fractions between categories is considered. One of the dominant sources of theoretical uncertainty is the prediction of the ggFprocess in the di\ufb00erent \ud835\udc41jetscategories. The ggFprocess gives a large contribution in categories with at least two jets. To estimate the variations due to the impact of higher-order contributions not included in the calculations and migration e\ufb00ects on the \ud835\udc41jetsggFcross-sections, the approach described in Refs. [24, 161] is used, which exploitsthelatestpredictionsfortheinclusivejetcross-sections. Inparticular,theuncertaintyfromthe choiceoffactorisationandrenormalisationscales,thechoiceofresummationscales,andthemigrations between the 0-jet and 1-jet phase-space bins or between the 1-jet and \u00152-jet bins are considered [24, 162\u2013164].

Anassumption is madethat higher-ordercorrections,appliedinamultiplicativeway,arethesameforboththeSMandtheBSMLO predictions and therefore no changes in the parameterisation are expected due to higher-order e\ufb00ects [171]. With the current amount of data, the constraints from the VBF,VHand\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3bproduction modes on the relevant Wilson coe\ufb03cients still allow a rather large range of parameter values in which the quadratic term (the last term in Eq. (1)) cannot be neglected even though its contribution is suppressed by \u039b4. Such dimension-six quadratic terms are therefore included in the EFT parameterisation. Since the linear terms from dimension-eight operators are suppressed by the same factor, they could in general also give similar non-negligible contributions. Dimension-eight terms are currently not available in the SMEFT model and are thus not taken into account.

Additionalsensitivitytointermediatevaluesofthe \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc35parameteris provided by the acceptance corrections, resulting in two additional allowed parameter regions that are disjoint from the region around the SM point.

As opposed to the CP-even case, however, the likelihood contours are symmetric around the \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc3be\ud835\udc3a=0axis, since there are no linear terms contributing to the ggFproduction 47 cross-section.

However, the impact of this term on the \ufb01nal result is negligible since the \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc3a (\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc3be\ud835\udc3a) parameter is already constrained to very small values compared with \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc3b(\ud835\udc50e\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc3b). Therefore, the \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3bproduction vertex mainly constrains the \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc3band\ud835\udc50e\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc3bparameters, while the ggFvertex constrains only the other two. The acceptance correction has no impact on these results. The CP-odd parameter range is less constrained than the CP-even one due to the missing linear \ud835\udc50e\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc3bterms in the cross-section parameterisation. 11 Conclusion Higgs boson properties are studied in the four-lepton decay channel using 139fb\u00001of LHC proton\u2013proton collision data atp\ud835\udc60=13TeVcollected by the ATLAS experiment.

Gauge theories require in fact thatgaugebosonsbemassless,inapparentcontradictionwithobservations. Inthiscontext,theseminal work ofBrout, Englert [3], Higgs [4\u20136] andGuralnik, Hagen and Kibble[7, 8], has provided aconsistent mechanism for the generation of gauge boson masses. The Glashow-Weinberg-Salam theory extended this mechanismproposingatheoryoftheelectroweakinteractions[9\u201311],introducingadoubletofcomplex scalar fields, which couples also to fermions, providing them with a mass that would otherwise be absent. This forms a major component of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. A salient prediction of the SM is the presence of a Higgs boson, whose mass is not predicted by the theory and needs to be estimatedexperimentally.

The inner detector (ID) system is immersed in a 2 T axial magnetic \ufb01eld and provides charged-particle tracking in the range j\ud835\udf02j\u009f2\u00955. A high-granularity silicon pixel detector covers the vertex region and typically provides four measurements per track. It is surrounded by a silicon microstrip tracker, which typically provides four measurement points per track. These silicon detectors are complemented by a transition radiation tracker, which enables radially extended track reconstruction up to j\ud835\udf02j=2\u00950.

Analytic models are used in the \ufb01t to describe the \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udf07\ud835\udf07 distributions for both the signal and background processes. 6.1 Signal modelling In the SM, the \ud835\udc3b!\ud835\udf07\ud835\udf07signal is predicted to be a narrow resonance with a width of 4\u00951MeVfor \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc3b=125\u009509GeV.

The observed properties of the particle, such as its couplings to Standard Model (SM) elementary particles, its spin and its parity, are so far consistent with the predictions for the SM Higgs boson [3\u20137]. MeasurementsofraredecaysoftheHiggsboson,suchas \ud835\udc3b!\u2113\u2113\ud835\udefewhere\u2113isanelectronormuon,can probecouplingmodi\ufb01cationsintroducedbypossibleextensionstotheSM[8]. Inaddition,suchthree-body Higgs boson decays can be used to probe \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc43-violation in the Higgs sector [9, 10].

Their respective fractions depend on the invariant mass of the dilepton pair, \ud835\udc5a\u2113\u2113. In this analysis only low-mass dilepton pairs with \ud835\udc5a\u2113\u2113\u009f30GeVare considered. This region is completelydominatedbythedecaythrough \ud835\udefe\u0003[8,11,12].

In addition, both the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations carried out searches atp\ud835\udc60=13TeVfor the closely related \ud835\udc3b!\ud835\udc4d\ud835\udefe process[13, 14].

Whentheinvariant mass of the two electrons is low and the transverse momentum of the dielectron system is high, their electromagnetic showers can overlap in the calorimeter. Therefore, the search for \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udefe\ufb01nal states requires the development of dedicated electron trigger and identi\ufb01cation algorithms. The search uses \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5dcollision data atp\ud835\udc60=13TeVrecorded with the ATLAS detector during Run 2 of the LHCbetween2015and2018,correspondingtoatotalintegratedluminosityof139 fb\u00001. Thesensitivityof the search is enhanced by dividing the selected events into mutually exclusive categories, according to the event topology and lepton \ufb02avour. The dominant background is the irreducible non-resonant production of \u2113\u2113\ud835\udefe. After event categorisation, the signal yield is extracted by a simultaneous \ufb01t of parametric functions to the reconstructed \u2113\u2113\ud835\udefeinvariant mass ( \ud835\udc5a\u2113\u2113\ud835\udefe) distributions in all categories. 2 2 ATLAS detector The ATLAS detector [16] covers nearly the entire solid angle around the collision point.1It consists of an inner tracking detector (ID) surrounded by a thin superconducting solenoid providing a 2Taxial magnetic\ufb01eld,electromagnetic(EM)andhadroncalorimeters,andamuonspectrometer(MS).TheID covers the pseudorapidity range j\ud835\udf02j\u009f2\u00955.

A two-level trigger system [20] was used during thep\ud835\udc60=13TeVdata-taking period. The \ufb01rst-level trigger (L1) is implemented in hardware and uses a subset of the detector information. This is followed by a software-based high-level trigger which runs algorithms similar to those in the o\ufb04ine reconstruction software, reducing the event rate to approximately 1 kHz from the maximum L1 rate of 100 kHz. 3 Data and simulated event samples Theanalysed \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5dcollisiondata correspondtothe fullrecorded LHCRun-2 datasetatp\ud835\udc60=13TeVwith an integrated luminosity of 139 fb\u00001after data quality requirements [21]. The events were collected with a combination of single-lepton, dilepton, diphoton, and lepton+photon triggers. Standard electron triggers, which require narrow, isolated EM energy clusters, are e\ufb03cient if the two electrons in the event have a very small angular separation \u0394\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52, as the two electrons produce a cluster that is similar to that of a single electron. For \u0394\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\u00a10\u00951, two separate EM clusters are typically produced. For the 2017 and 2018 data-taking periods, a dedicated trigger was introduced which requires at least one photon with \ud835\udc5dT\u00a135GeVand at least one EM cluster with \ud835\udc5dT\u00a125GeVmatched to at least one ID track. The EM cluster must have low hadronic leakage, but no requirement is imposed on the width of the shower, which allows this new trigger to recover a signi\ufb01cant fraction of the signal with 0\u0095025\u009f\u0394\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\u009f0\u00951.

The analysis is performed using a data set recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC with proton\u2013proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 139 fb\u00001.

This result combines searches in four exclusive categories targeting the production of the Higgs boson via gluon fusion, via vector boson fusion, in association with a vector boson, and in as- sociation with a top quark-antiquark pair. The analysis is performed using proton- proton collision data atps=13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 137 fb\u00001, recorded by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC. An excess of events over the background expectation is observed in data with a signi\ufb01cance of 3.0 stan- dard deviations, where the expectation for the standard model (SM) Higgs boson with mass of 125.38 GeV is 2.5. The combination of this result with that from data recorded atps=7 and 8 TeV, corresponding to integrated luminosities of 5.1 and 19.7 fb\u00001, respectively, increases both the expected and observed signi\ufb01cances by 1%.

The Yukawa couplings of the Higgs boson to fermions of the \ufb01rst and second generation, however, have yet to be established experimentally. The SM predicts that the strengths of the couplings of the Higgs boson to fermions are proportional to the fermion masses [18\u201321]. Consequently, the branching fractions of the Higgs boson to fermions of the \ufb01rst and second generation are expected to be small, and their measurement at hadron colliders is challenging. The expected branching fraction for the decay of the Higgs boson with mass of 125 GeV to a pair of muons is B(H!m+m\u0000) =2.18\u000210\u00004[22]. The study of H !m+m\u0000 decays is of particular importance since it is the most experimentally sensitive probe of the Higgs boson couplings to second-generation fermions at the LHC. The CMS Collaboration performed a search for H !m+m\u0000decays using a combination of proton-proton (pp) collision data collected at centre-of-mass energies of 7, 8, and 13 TeV, cor- responding to integrated luminosities of 5.0, 19.7, and 35.9 fb\u00001, respectively. An observed (expected in absence of H !m+m\u0000decays) upper limit of 2.9 (2.2) times the SM prediction was set at the 95% con\ufb01dence level (CL) on the product of the Higgs boson production cross section andB(H!m+m\u0000)[23]. The corresponding signal strength, relative to the SM expectation, was m=1.0\u00061.0. The ATLAS Collaboration has performed a search for H !m+m\u0000decays using 13 TeV pp collision data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 139 fb\u00001, resulting in an observed (expected for m=0) upper limit at 95% CL of 2.2 (1.1) times the SM prediction and a signal strength m=1.2\u00060.6 [24]. This paper reports the \ufb01rst evidence for H !m+m\u0000decays, obtained using pp collision data collected by the CMS experiment atps=13"}

The \ufb01nal states considered contain two prompt, isolated, and oppo- sitely charged muons from the Higgs boson decay, with a narrow resonant invariant mass peak around the Higgs boson mass for signal events. The dimuon mass serves as a powerful discriminant against SM background processes. Events are separated into mutually exclusive categories targeting the main production modes of the Higgs boson at hadron colliders, namely gluon fusion (ggH), vector boson fusion (VBF), associated production with a vector boson (VH, where V =W or Z), and associated production with a top quark-antiquark pair (t tH). Results are given for mH=125.38\u00060.14 GeV, corresponding to the most precise measurement of the Higgs boson mass to date [25]. The ggH and VBF Higgs boson production modes have the largest cross sections at the LHC, and the event categories targeting these production modes are the most sensitive in this mea- surement. In the ggH category, the \ufb01nal state may contain additional hadronic jets produced by initial-state (ISR) or \ufb01nal-state (FSR) radiation. The largest background in this category con- sists of Drell\u2013Yan (DY) events in which an off-shell Z boson decays to a pair of muons. Smaller background contaminations arise from t t and diboson (WW, WZ, ZZ) processes. In the VBF analysis, the \ufb01nal state contains two jets with a large pseudorapidity separation ( Dhjj) and large dijet invariant mass ( mjj). These characteristic features allow a signi\ufb01cant suppression of the DY background, providing an expected sensitivity to H !m+m\u0000decays that is better than that of the ggH category, despite the smaller VBF production cross section. The VH signal events tar- geted by this analysis contain leptonic decays of the W or Z boson. This results in a \ufb01nal state with three or more"}

Events in this cate- gory are therefore characterized by the presence of one or more b quark jets, and may contain additional charged leptons. The dominant backgrounds in the t tH category are the t t and t tZ processes. This paper is organized as follows: after a brief description of the CMS detector in Section 2, the event reconstruction, simulation, and selection are discussed in Sections 3, 4, and 5, re- spectively. Sections 6, 7, 8, and 9 are dedicated to the description of the four exclusive event categories designed to target the VBF, ggH, t tH, and VH production modes, respectively. Fi- nally, Section 10 describes the main results and their combination which are then summarized in Section 11. 2 The CMS detector The central feature of the CMS apparatus is a superconducting solenoid of 6 m internal diame- ter, providing a magnetic \ufb01eld of 3.8 T. Within the solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scintilla- tor hadron calorimeter (HCAL), each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections. Forward calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. Muons are detected in gas-ionization chambers embedded in the steel \ufb02ux-return yoke out- side the solenoid. Events of interest are selected using a two-tiered trigger system [26]. The \ufb01rst level (L1) is composed of custom hardware processors, which use information from the calorimeters and muon detectors to select events at a rate of about 100 kHz. The second level, known as high-level trigger (HLT), is a software-based system which runs a version of the CMS full event"}

A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a de\ufb01nition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in Ref.

The energy of photons is obtained from the ECAL measurement. The energy of electrons is determined from a combination of the electron momentum at the primary interaction vertex as determined by the silicon tracker, the energy of the correspond- ing ECAL cluster, and the energy sum of all bremsstrahlung photons spatially compatible with originating from the electron track. The energy of charged hadrons is determined from a combi- nation of their momentum measured in the silicon tracker and the matching ECAL and HCAL energy deposits, corrected for the response function of the calorimeters to hadronic showers. The energy of neutral hadrons is obtained from the corresponding corrected ECAL and HCAL energies. Finally, the momentum of muons is obtained from the curvature of the corresponding track reconstructed in the silicon tracker as well as in the muon system. For each event, hadronic jets are clustered from these reconstructed particles using the infrared and collinear-safe anti- kTalgorithm [29, 30] with a distance parameter of R=0.4. The jet mo- mentum is determined from the vectorial sum of the momenta of all particles in the jet, and is found from simulation to be, on average, within 5 to 10% of the true transverse momentum over the whole pTspectrum and detector acceptance. Additional pp interactions within the same or nearby bunch crossings (pileup) can contribute additional tracks and"}

To mitigate this effect, charged particles identi\ufb01ed as 3 originating from pileup vertices are discarded and an offset correction is applied to subtract the remaining contributions from neutral particles [31]. Jet energy corrections are derived from simulation to bring, on average, the measured response of jets to that of particle-level jets. In situ measurements of the momentum balance in dijet, g+jets, Z+jets, and multijet events are used to account for any residual differences in jet energy scale between data and simulation. The jet energy resolution amounts typically to 15\u201320% at 30 GeV, 10% at 100 GeV, and 5% at 1 TeV [31]. Additional selection criteria are applied to each jet to remove those potentially dom- inated by anomalous contributions from various subdetector components or reconstruction failures [32]. The missing transverse momentum vector ~pmiss Tis computed as the negative vector pTsum of all the PF candidates in an event, and its magnitude is denoted as pmiss T[33]. The ~pmiss T is modi\ufb01ed to account for corrections to the energy scale of the reconstructed jets in the event. Events with anomalously high- pmiss Tcan arise from a variety of reconstruction failures, detector malfunctions, or noncollision backgrounds. Such events are rejected by event \ufb01lters that are designed to identify more than 85\u201390% of the spurious high- pmiss Tevents with a mistagging rate smaller than 0.1% [33]. Primary vertices are reconstructed from charged-particle tracks in the event. The candidate vertex with the largest value of the sum of the p2 Tof all associated physics objects is taken to be the primary pp interaction vertex. In this sum, the physics objects are the jets, clustered using the jet \ufb01nding algorithm [29, 30] with the tracks assigned to candidate vertices as inputs, and the associated pmiss T, taken"}

Working points (WPs) that yield either a 1% (medium WP) or a 10% (loose WP) probability of misidentifying a light-\ufb02avour (udsg) jet with pT>30 GeV as a b quark jet are used.

The simulated events at the ME level for both signal and background processes, except for Zjj-EW production, are interfaced with PYTHIA v8.2.2 or higher [68] to simulate the shower and hadronization of partons in the initial and \ufb01nal states, along with the underlying event de- scription. The CUETP8M1 tune [69] is used for simulated samples corresponding to the 2016 data-taking period, while the CP5 tune [70] is used for the 2017 and 2018 simulated data. Sim- ulated VBF signal events are interfaced with PYTHIA but, rather than the standard pT-ordered parton shower, the dipole shower is chosen to model the ISR and FSR [71]. The dipole shower correctly takes into account the structure of the colour \ufb02ow between incoming and outgoing quark lines, and its predictions are found to be in good agreement with NNLO QCD calcula- tions, as reported in Ref. [72]. In contrast, the parton shower (PS), hadronization, and simula- tion of the underlying event for the Zjj-EW process are performed with the HERWIG ++ (2016 simulation) and HERWIG 7 (2017 and 2018) programs [73], as they have shown to better match the observed data compared to the pT-ordered PYTHIA predictions in the description of the ad- ditional hadronic activity in the rapidity range between the two leading jets [74].

Events of interest are selected by the HLT using single muon triggers that have a pTthreshold of 27 (24) GeV for data recorded in 2017 (2016, 2018). After passing the trigger selections, each event is required to contain at least two oppositely charged muons with pT>20 GeV,jhj<2.4, and passing certain selection requirements on the number of hits in the silicon tracker and in the muon systems, as well as on the quality of the \ufb01tted muon track [35]. Each muon is also required to be isolated in order to reject events with nonprompt or misidenti\ufb01ed muon candidates. The muon isolation variable, as de\ufb01ned in Section 3, is required to be less than 25% of the muon pT. Muons from the Higgs boson decay satisfy these identi\ufb01cation and isolation requirements with an average selection ef\ufb01ciency of about 95%. In addition, at least one of the two muons is required to have pT>29(26)GeV for data collected in 2017 (2016, 2018), ensuring nearly 100% trigger ef\ufb01ciency.

Therefore, the precision of the muon pTmeasurement can be improved by including the interaction point as an additional constraint in the muon track \ufb01t. This is implemented via an analytical correction to the muon pTproportional to the product of the muon p2 T, its charge, and the minimum dis- tance in the transverse plane between the muon track and the beam position. The correction is derived in simulated Z !mmevents and checked in both data and simulation to provide an equivalent result to re\ufb01tting the muon track with the interaction point constraint. The resulting improvement in the expected mmmresolution in signal events ranges from 3 to 10%, depending on muon pT,h, and the data-taking period. In a nonnegligible fraction of signal events, a muon from the Higgs boson decay radiates a photon that carries away a signi\ufb01cant fraction of the muon momentum. If not taken into ac- count, this worsens the resolution of the dimuon invariant mass ( mmm) peak in signal events. Furthermore, if the FSR photon falls in the isolation cone of the corresponding muon candi- date, it can signi\ufb01cantly increase the value of the isolation sum, thereby creating an inef\ufb01ciency in selecting signal events. Therefore, a procedure is implemented to identify and recover the contribution of FSR photons similar to that described in Ref. [9]. In order to preserve the over- all signal acceptance of the dimuon selection described above, the FSR recovery is applied only to muons with pT>20 GeV andjhj<2.4. Photons with pT>2 GeV andjhj<2.5 that are not associated with reconstructed electrons are considered as FSR photon candidates if they lie inside a cone of R=0.5 around a muon track. These candidates are then required to be loosely isolated and collinear with the muon such that (Sipi T(DR(g,i)<0.3))/pT(g)<1.8 andDR(m,g)/p2 T(g)<0.012, where pT(g)is the pTof"}

In the case of multiple FSR candidates associated with a muon, the candidate with the smallest value ofDR(m,g)/p2 T(g)is chosen. The momentum of the photon is added to that of the muon and its contribution to the muon isolation sum is ignored. The FSR recovery increases the signal ef\ufb01ciency by about 2% and improves the mmmresolution by about 3%. In order to maximize the analysis sensitivity, event candidates selected with the requirements described above are separated into independent and nonoverlapping classes based on the fea- tures of the \ufb01nal state expected from each production mode. Events with b-tagged jets are assigned to the t tH production category, which is further split into the hadronic and leptonic subclasses by the presence of additional charged leptons ( mor e) in the \ufb01nal state.

These requirements suppress the t t and single top quark backgrounds and ensure mutual exclusivity between the VBF and t tH categories. Moreover, events containing an additional muon (electron) with pT>20 GeV and jhj<2.4(2.5)passing the selection criteria described in Section 9 are discarded.

The use of soft track-jet observables is a robust and validated method to reconstruct the hadronization products of partons with energy as low as a few GeV [81]. The number of soft track-jets in an event with pT>5 GeV, as well as the scalar pTsum of all track-jets with pT>2 GeV, are used as additional input variables. Finally, since jets in signal events are expected to originate from quarks, whereas in the DY process they can also be initiated by gluons, the quark-gluon likelihood [82] of the two leading jets is also used as input to the DNN.

In such data-driven analyses, the precision of the background estimate strictly depends on the number of observed events in the mass sidebands, thereby limiting the per- formance in the high purity subcategories that contain a small number of events. In contrast, the approach presented here relies on the precision with which the simulation is able to pre- dict the different background components. The uncertainty in this prediction is validated and constrained using the signal-depleted sideband regions. Theoretical uncertainties affect both the expected rate and the shape of signal and background histograms (templates) used in the \ufb01t.

These theoretical uncertainties are correlated across years and regions (VBF-SR and VBF-SB) but are uncorrelated between processes.

The improve- ment in precision re\ufb02ects the (uncorrelated) time evolution of some systematic effects. During 10 the 2016 and 2017 data-taking periods, a gradual shift in the timing of the inputs of the ECAL L1 trigger in the forward endcap region ( jhj>2.4) led to a speci\ufb01c inef\ufb01ciency. A correction for this effect was determined using an unbiased data sample and is found to be relevant in events with high- pTjets with 2.4 <jhj<3.0. This correction is about 2 (3)% at mjj=400 GeV in the 2016 (2017) data-taking period and it increases to about 6 (9)% for mjj>2 TeV. A systematic uncertainty corresponding to 20% of this correction is considered.

These jets originate either from the soft emissions produced by the PS or from pileup interactions. The normalization of this term is left \ufb02oating in the \ufb01t and is directly constrained by the observed data events with low DNN score belonging to the VBF-SR and VBF-SB regions. Because of signi\ufb01cant varia- tions in the detector response in the forward region over time, these normalization parameters are considered uncorrelated across years.

This is required by the chosen analysis strategy, in which events are \ufb01rst divided into independent subcategories based on the BDT output, then a potential sig- nal is extracted from each subcategory by searching for a narrow peak over a smoothly falling background in the mmmdistribution. In this category, given the prior knowledge of the expected DY background shape and the large number of data events in the mass sideband around the peak that can be used to constrain the background, this strategy provides a robust background estimate from data while maximizing the analysis sensitivity.

Lastly, the total number of jets in the event with pT>25 GeV andjhj<4.7 is also used as input to the BDT. The signal simulation considered in the training of the multivariate discriminators includes the ggH, VBF, VH, and t tH processes. The ggH sample used in the training is generated via POWHEG since it provides positively weighted events at NLO in QCD. In later stages of the analysis, the prediction from M ADGRAPH 5aMC@NLO is used instead since it provides a more accurate description of gluon fusion events accompanied by more than one jet, as detailed in Section 4. The background simulation consists of DY, t t, single top quark, diboson, and Zjj-EW processes. Only events with mmmin the range 115\u2013135 GeV are included in the training. Signal and background events both contain two prompt muons in the \ufb01nal state, and the correspond- ing dimuon mass resolution ( smm/mmm) does not discriminate between them. For this reason, smm/mmmis not added as an input to the BDT. Instead, signal events in the BDT training are assigned a weight inversely proportional to the expected mass resolution, derived from the uncertainties in the pTmeasurements of the individual muon tracks. This weighting improves the average signal smm/mmmin the high-score BDT region by assigning increased importance to the high-resolution signal events.

Each of these functions contains three freely \ufb02oating shape parameters. The nonanalytical shape derived from the FEWZ generator is obtained by simulat- ing DY events at NNLO precision in QCD and NLO accuracy in EW theory and interpolating the resulting mmmdistribution using a spline function [94, 95].

For the func- tions including Bernstein polynomials, a Fisher test [98] is used to determine the maximum degree of the polynomials to be considered in the \ufb01t. The chosen functional forms \ufb01t the data with a c2probability larger than 5% in all event categories. Pseudodata sets are generated across all event categories from the post-\ufb01t background shapes obtained for each type of function in each subcategory, taking into account the uncertainties in the \ufb01t parameters as well as their correlations, and injecting a given number of signal events. Signal-plus-background \ufb01ts are performed on the pseudodata sets using the core-pdf method. The median difference between the measured and injected signal yields, relative to the post-\ufb01t uncertainty in the signal yields, gives an estimate of the bias due to the choice of the back- ground model. The bias measured in each BDT category, as well as from pseudodata sets in which the signal is injected simultaneously in all event categories, is smaller than 20% of the 18 post-\ufb01t uncertainty on the signal yield. Including these observed deviations as spurious sig- nals leads to a change in the overall uncertainty in the measured signal rate of less than 1% and is therefore neglected. The core-pdf method employed in this analysis yields an improvement in sensitivity of about 10% with respect to the background functions used in the previous re- sult [23]. It also ensures a negligible bias in the measured signal with signi\ufb01cantly fewer total degrees of freedom in the signal extraction \ufb01t.

The high BDT score region of the t tH hadronic category is enriched in events with large jet multiplicity, where the t t and DY background predictions rely on a sig- ni\ufb01cant number of jets from the PS and are known to not entirely reproduce the data [103].

Furthermore, theoretical uncertainties in the prediction of the Higgs boson produc- tion cross section, decay rate, and acceptance are also considered. Rate uncertainties are taken into account in the signal extraction as nuisance parameters acting on the relative signal yield with log-normal constraints. The potential bias due to the choice of the parametric function used to model the background is estimated using the same procedure employed in the t tH analysis, detailed in Section 8. The set of parametric functional forms considered in the bias studies includes BWZ, BWZ g, sum of exponentials, Bernstein polynomials, and sum of power laws. The chosen parametrization maximizes the expected sensitivity without introducing a signi\ufb01cant bias in the measured sig- nal yield.

The signal strength measured in the H !m+m\u0000analysis cannot be trans- lated directly into a measurement of the Higgs boson coupling to muons because it is also sensitive to the interactions between the Higgs boson and several SM particles involved in the production processes considered, primarily the top quark and vector boson couplings. These Higgs boson couplings to other particles are constrained by combining the result of this anal- ysis with those presented in Ref. [10], based on pp collision data recorded by the CMS exper- iment atps=13 TeV in 2016 corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb\u00001. Under the assumption that there are no new particles contributing to the Higgs boson total width, Higgs boson production and decay rates in each category are expressed in terms of coupling modi\ufb01ers within the k-framework [107].

{"source": "1808.08242v2.pdf", "text": "support this hypothesis. Recently, the CMS and AT- LAS Collaborations reported observations of the Higgs boson produced in association with a top quark pair that are compatible with the SM prediction, representing the \ufb01rst direct mea- surements of the Higgs boson coupling to quarks [30, 31]. The decay H!bb, with a predicted branching fraction of about 58% [32] for a Higgs boson mass of mH=125 GeV, is the most prevalent decay mode but has not yet been established unequivocally. A precise measurement of the rate for this process directly probes the Yukawa coupling of the Higgs boson to a down-type quark, and provides a necessary test of the hy- pothesis that the Higgs \ufb01eld is the source of mass generation in the charged fermion sector of the SM [33, 34]. At both the LHC and the Tevatron the most sensitive production process in the search for H!bb decays is when the Higgs boson is produced in association with a vector boson (VH). The CDF and D0 Collaborations at the Tevatron reported an excess of events in this channel with a signi\ufb01cance of 2.8 standard deviations ( s) at a mass of mH=125 GeV [35]. Last year, the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations reported evidence for the VH, H !bb process at a mass of mH=125 GeV corresponding to observed (expected) signi\ufb01cances of 3.6 (4.0) sand 3.8 (3.8) s, respectively, combining data collected during Run 1 atps=7 and 8 TeV, and Run 2 at 13 TeV [36, 37]. Searches for the H !bb decay in other production processes, with less sensitivity than VH, have also been reported at the LHC [38\u201344].

The data comprise proton-proton (pp) collisions recorded atps=13 TeV by the CMS detector at the LHC in 2017, correspond- ing to a total integrated luminosity of 41.3 fb\u00001[45]. Five distinct \ufb01nal states are considered: Z(nn)H, W (mn)H, W (en)H, Z(mm)H, and Z (ee)H, corresponding to three channels with 0, 1, or 2 charged leptons from the vector boson decay. In addition, two identi\ufb01ed jets due to hadroniza- tion of bottom quarks (b jets) from the Higgs boson decay are required. Important background processes include the production of W and Z bosons in association with jets (V+jets), produc- tion of top quark pairs (t t) and single top quarks (t), diboson (WW, WZ, ZZ), and multijet (QCD) events. The analysis presented here closely follows the methods previously used to search for the VH, H!bb process [37] and incorporates several improvements, including more ef\ufb01cient identi\ufb01- cation of b jets, better dijet mass resolution, and the use of different multivariate discriminant techniques that better separate signal from background. For each channel, a signal region en- riched in VH events is selected together with several control regions, each enriched in events from individual background processes. A simultaneous binned-likelihood \ufb01t to the shape and yield (normalization) of speci\ufb01c distributions for the signal and control regions for all channels combined is used to extract a possible Higgs boson signal. To validate the procedure, the same methodology is used to extract a signal for the associated production process VZ, with Z !bb, which has an identical \ufb01nal state to VH with H !bb, but with a production cross section 5 to 15 times larger, depending on the kinematic regime considered. The result from this measure- ment is combined with those of similar measurements"}

The central feature of the CMS apparatus is a superconducting solenoid of 6 m internal diame- ter, providing a magnetic \ufb01eld of 3.8 T. A silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter, and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter, each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections, reside within the solenoid. Forward calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. Muons are detected in gas-ionization chambers embedded in the steel \ufb02ux-return yoke outside the solenoid. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a de\ufb01nition of the coordinate system and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in [47]. Signal and background processes are simulated with several Monte Carlo (MC) event genera- tors, while the CMS detector response is modeled with G EANT 4 [48].

The deepCSV algorithm provides a continuous discriminator score combining information about tracks displaced from the pri- mary vertex, identi\ufb01ed secondary vertices, jet kinematic variables, and information related to the presence of soft leptons in the jet. Of the two jets forming the Higgs boson candidate, the one with a larger deepCSV score is required to satisfy a tight working point with misidenti- \ufb01cation rate of 0.1% for light quark and gluon jets, while the jet with a lower deepCSV score (DCSV2) must satisfy a loose working point with a 10% misidenti\ufb01cation rate. All backgrounds are substantially reduced by requiring large pT(V)[80]. The requirements are pmiss T>170 GeV and pT(V)>150 GeV in the 0- and 1-lepton channels, respectively, while two regions are used in the 2-lepton channel: 50 <pT(V)\u0014150 GeV and pT(V)>150 GeV.

All results reported here are obtained for a Higgs boson mass of mH=125.09 GeV [26]. For the 2017 data, the observed signi\ufb01cance is 3.3 s above the background-only hypothesis, while 3.1 sis expected for the SM Higgs boson. The corresponding measured signal strength is m=1.08\u00060.34, where the uncertainty is a combi- nation of statistical and systematic components. Table 1 lists the major sources of uncertainty 5 and their observed impact on mfrom the \ufb01t. Dominant systematic uncertainties arise from the background normalizations, simulated sample size, b-tagging ef\ufb01ciency and misidenti\ufb01cation rates, and V+jets modeling. All sources of systematic uncertainty are included in the \ufb01t as independent nuisance parameters.
