The energy calibration steps are discussed in detail, with emphasisontheimprovementsintroducedinthispaper. Theabsoluteenergyscaleissetusing a large sample of 𝑍-boson decays into electron–positron pairs, and its residual dependence on the electron energy is used for the first time to further constrain systematic uncertainties. The achieved calibration uncertainties are typically 0.05% for electrons from resonant 𝑍-boson decays, 0.4% at 𝐸T∼10GeV, and 0.3% at 𝐸T∼1TeV; for photons at 𝐸T∼60GeV, they are 0.2% on average. This is more than twice as precise as the previous calibration. The new energy calibration is validated using 𝐽/𝜓→𝑒𝑒and radiative 𝑍-boson decays. ©2024 CERN for the benefit of the ATLAS Collaboration.

Optimalenergyreconstructionandcalibrationoftheelectromagneticcalorimeterisnecessary forallanalysesinvolvingelectronsandphotons,andespeciallyforprecisemeasurementsofthemassesand properties of the Higgs, 𝑊and𝑍bosons. The present paper describes the calorimeter energy calibration using the Run 2 data sample. Thecalibrationschemecomprisesseveralsteps: asimulation-basedoptimizationoftheenergymeasurement for electrons and photons, corrections for observed differences between data and simulation, calibration of the layers of the calorimeter and a final adjustment of the global energy scale using the abundant sample of electron–positron pairs from 𝑍-boson decays. The resulting calibration corrections are validated using electrons from 𝐽/𝜓decays and photons from radiative 𝑍-boson decays. TheprocedureappliedtothefullRun2datasetissimilartotheoneinRefs.[1,2]. Comparedtotheprevious publication,themethodologyhasbeen updatedinordertoreducetheimpactofthedominantsourcesof uncertainty: the offline reconstruction of electrons and photons in the calorimeter moved from a clustering algorithmthatproducedfixed-sizeclusterstooneproducingvariable-size‘superclusters’[3];muonsare now used for the presampler calibration, instead of electrons and photons; the layer intercalibration is now obtainedbycombiningscalesextractedusingbothelectronsandmuons;finally,dedicateddataallowed further studies of the intercalibration of the high- and medium-gain electronics readouts.

Closest to the collision point, ATLAS is instrumented with an inner tracking detector (ID) covering the pseudorapidity range of |𝜂|<2.5and consisting of a silicon pixel detector, includingtheinsertableB-layerinstalledasanewinnermostlayerbeforeRun2[5,6],followedbyasilicon strip detector (SCT), and a transition radiation tracker (TRT) in the region |𝜂|<2.0. The ID is surrounded byasuperconductingsolenoidproducinganaxialmagneticfieldof2Tsuchthattheensembleenables efficient reconstruction of the tracks and momenta of charged particles, measurement of primary and secondary vertices, discrimination between electrons and pions, and reconstruction of photon conversions in ID material at radii up to 800 mm. The solenoid surrounding the ID is encompassed by an electromagnetic (EM) calorimeter, which consists ofleadabsorbersfoldedinanaccordiongeometryandimmersedinaliquid-argon(LAr)bath. TheEM calorimeterisdividedintothreeregions,eachcontainedinaseparatecryostat: thebarrelsection(EMB) covering the central pseudorapidity region |𝜂|<1.475and two endcaps (EMEC) covering the acceptance regions 1.375<|𝜂|<3.2. The EMB and EMEC are segmented longitudinally into three (two) layers within|𝜂|<2.5(2.5<|𝜂|<3.2)withvariablecellsizes,suchthatthedirectionofphotonshowerscanbe measured. Thefirstlayer(Layer1)spanstheregions |𝜂|<1.45and1.5<|𝜂|<2.4,andhasathickness between three and five radiation lengths ( 𝑋0), depending on 𝜂, and cells with a fine segmentation of 0.003×0.1inΔ𝜂×Δ𝜙intheEMB,providingexcellentdiscriminationbetweensinglephotonshowersand the showers of two nearly collinear photons from high-momentum pion decay.

Scintillators are placed between the barrel and endcap cryostats ( 1.37<|𝜂|<1.52) to improve the energy measurement in this region. The EM calorimeter is surrounded by an iron/scintillator hadron calorimeter in the region |𝜂|<1.7. In the endcap regions, copper/LAr calorimeters are used up to |𝜂|=3.2.

The energy deposited in the calorimeter cell is estimated through an optimal filtering procedure applied to the four samples after pedestal subtraction [8], corrected by factors describing the conversion from ADC count tocurrentandfromcurrenttoenergy. Thepedestal,ADC-to-currentconversionandsignalshapeofall calorimeter cells are derived from specific electronics calibration data. The pile-up dependence of the resulting energy value is corrected for using the measured instantaneous luminosity for the considered bunch crossings. Electrons and photons are reconstructed from energy deposits in the cells, using a dynamic, variable cluster-sizealgorithmtoformsuperclusters[3,9],allowingtherecoveryofenergyfrombremsstrahlung photons or from electrons from photon conversions.

The Loose criterion is independent of the conversion status of the photon. The Tight selection uses shower shape information from the first calorimeter layer and it is optimized separately for the two cases, accounting for the opening angle of the 𝑒+𝑒−pair in the magnetic field, which may impacttheresponseforconvertedphotons.

Specialsamples,called‘low-pile-up’samplesinthefollowing,were recorded in 2017 and 2018 at low instantaneous luminosity, with ⟨𝜇⟩∼2; after applying data-quality requirements, the corresponding integrated luminosity amounts to 340 pb−1. Themeasurementsoftheelectromagneticenergyresponseusealargesampleof 𝑍→𝑒𝑒eventsselected with single-electron and dielectron triggers [15].

The sample contains ∼260000events. 6 Samples of 𝑍→ℓℓ𝛾events (ℓ=𝑒,𝜇), used to validate the photon energy scale, were selected with the same triggers as for the 𝑍→𝑒𝑒sample for the electron channel and with single-muon or dimuon triggers [16] for the muon channel.

The CT10[20]parton distribution function (PDF) set was used in the matrix element calculation. The AZNLO set of tuned parameters[21]andthe CTEQ6L1 [22]PDFsetwereusedinthemodellingofnon-perturbativeeffects.

The A14 set of tuned parameters [24] was used together with the CTEQ6L1 PDF set, and EvtGen1.2.0 [25] was used to model 𝑏- and𝑐-hadron decays.

At high|𝜂|, these uncertainties are dominated by a 50% uncertainty in the simulated PP0 material. but biases remain that depend on the particle type (electron, unconverted or converted photon) and energy. ThemodelusedforthepassivematerialanditsassociateduncertaintieswasderivedfromRun1andpartial Run 2 data [1, 10], and is summarized briefly below. The model of the ID is based on measurements performed during its construction [4], leading to a 5% uncertainty in the amount of material. In Run 2, a 10% uncertainty is assigned to the material of the insertable B-layer, and 25% to that of the inner-detector service patch panel [33], affecting the high- |𝜂| region. The materialbetween the IDand the LArcalorimeter was probed [1]using the longitudinaldevelopment of electron and photon showers. The ratio of the energies deposited in the first and second accordion layers was found to be sensitive to the total amount of material traversed by these particles before entering thecalorimeter. Aftercalibrationofthelayers’energyresponse,thisratiowasmeasuredwitharelative precision of about 1% in the barrel, and about 2% in the endcaps, leading to a determination of the passive material with a typical precision of 5% 𝑋0for|𝜂|<1.3, 10%𝑋0for1.6<|𝜂|<2.1, and up to 20%𝑋0for2.1<|𝜂|<2.4.

The resulting material model is presented in Figure 2(a), which summarizes the passive material between the interaction point and the calorimeter. The measured passive material is compared with the simulation and its uncertainties in Figure 2(b). 8 4 Overview of the calibration procedure The different steps in the procedure used to calibrate the energy response for electrons and photons described in this paper are illustrated in Figure 3, and summarized below. simulationdata J/ψ→ee, Z→ll𝛾data-driven

The energy of an electron or photon candidate is built from the energy of a cluster of cells in the electromagnetic calorimeter. The measurement of electron and photon energies is optimized using a simulation-based boosted-decision-tree regression algorithm, combining energy deposits belonging to the reconstructed supercluster, in the presampler and in the calorimeter layers. The optimization is performed separately for electrons, converted photons and unconverted photons, taking into account the particle position. It is the same as the one used in Ref. [3] and the methodology is discussed in detail in Ref. [2]. SincetheEMcalorimeterissegmentedindepth,thelongitudinallayersshouldbecalibratedseparately to provide a correct description of the calorimeter response as a function of 𝐸T(step 1). After these corrections, the simulation-based calibration is applied identically to the cluster energies reconstructed from collision data and simulated event samples (step 2). A set of additional corrections is applied to data to account for response variations not included in the simulation in specific detector regions, e.g. regions with non-optimal high voltage, azimuthal non- uniformities, orbiasesassociated withthe liquid-argoncalorimeter’selectronics calibration(step 3). The stability of the calorimeter response as a function of azimuth, time and pile-up is also studied. A final adjustment of the calorimeter response is derived from samples of 𝑍→𝑒𝑒events, so that the peak ofthe𝑍resonancereconstructedindatacoincideswiththatinthesimulation. Theresponsecorrectionsare appliedtothedata. Usingthesameeventsamples,itisfoundthattheresolutionindataisslightlyworse than that in simulation, and appropriate corrections are derived and applied to the simulation to match thedata(steps4,5). Thepassivematerialmodelandtheintercalibrationcorrectionscarryuncertainties thataffecttheenergycalibrationwithaspecificdependenceontheparticle 𝐸T. Measuringtheresidual energy dependence of the energy scale thus allows further adjustments of the calibration model, and provides additional constraints on the associated uncertainties. High-precision measurements, such as 9 those measuring the masses of the Higgs

The calibration factors extracted from 𝑍→𝑒𝑒events are assumed to reflect the intrinsic response of thecalorimeter,andarethusappliedidenticallytoelectronsandphotons. Nevertheless,photon-specific correctionsareneededtoaccountfordifferencesinthelateraldevelopmentofelectronandphotonshowers (step 6). Finally, the calibration chain is validated in data with low- 𝐸Telectron candidates from 𝐽/𝜓→𝑒𝑒 decays, and with photon candidates from radiative 𝑍-boson decays (step 7). 5 Effects on the uniformity and stability of the energy response Thissectiondiscussesthestabilityofthecalorimeterenergyresponseasafunctionofazimuthalangle,time, and pile-up. The dependence of the energy reconstruction on the readout electronics (ADC calibration and readout gain) is also discussed. Not all effects are modelled in the simulation. Corrections are defined for theADCcalibrationandtheazimuthalnon-uniformity,whileasystematicuncertaintyisassignedforthe observed dependence of the energy measurement on the readout gain. 5.1 Uniformity Gravity-inducedmechanicaldeformationsofthecalorimetercausevariationsinthesizeoftheliquid-argon gaps between the absorbers as a function of azimuthal angle. The resulting energy response variations are at the level of 0.1%–0.2% in the barrel, and up to 1% in the endcaps. Energy corrections are derived from themodulationsoftheresponseasafunctionof 𝜙,separatelyinsixintervalsofabsolutepseudorapidity (0–0.6,0.6–1.0,1.0–1.37,1.37–1.55,1.55–1.82,1.82–2.47). Ineach |𝜂|interval,therelativeresponseis defined from profiles of 𝐸T/⟨𝐸T⟩in𝑍-boson decays, where 𝐸Tis the electron transverse energy at a given 𝜙value, and⟨𝐸T⟩is the average over 𝜙. The effect of this correction is illustrated in Figure 4. While the 𝜙-averaged energy response is unchanged by construction, the better uniformity is expected to yield a small improvement in the overall energy resolution. Inpractice, theresolution’sconstantterm, discussedinSection7, isreducedby5%–10%inthe endcaps, where the correction is most significant. 5.2 Stability The stability of the calorimeter response is studied using the reconstructed peak position of the dielectron massdistribution, 𝑚𝑒𝑒/⟨𝑚𝑒𝑒⟩,in𝑍→𝑒𝑒candidateevents. ThisisillustratedinFigure5(a)forthedata takenbetween2015and2018. Stabilityatthelevelof0.05%isobservedoverthefulldata-takingperiod.

This correction was computed from 2015+2016 data and applied to the full Run 2 sample. The observed non-zero residuals have no impact on the final result reflects data taken in 2017, and the discrepancies observed in this region justify the extraction of dedicated energy-scale corrections for each data-taking year. More details are given in Section 7. The stability of the response as a function of the number of reconstructed collision vertices ( 𝑁vtx) [34] is shown in Figure 5(c). Classifying events according to 𝑁vtx, related to the number of interactions in the specific bunch crossing, biases the pile-up activity of colliding bunches relative to the average. In this case the compensation of the pile-up contributions to the reconstructed energy by the bipolar shaping becomes imperfect, giving rise to the observed slope. The description of this effect in the simulation is accurate to0.1%for⟨𝜇⟩<25,risingto0.5%athigh 𝑁vtx. Thelargerdiscrepancyathigh 𝑁vtxreflectstheeffect observed for⟨𝜇⟩. 5.3 ADC non-linearity correction The energy reconstruction in a LAr calorimeter cell is based on a linear conversion from ADC counts to current, and an additional factor converting current into energy. In practice, the energy response of each cell is determined during dedicated electronics calibration runs, parameterizing the relation between theinjectedcurrentandthemeasuredADCcountusingalinearfunction. Thefitstothecalibrationdata show non-zero residuals, caused by intrinsic non-linear behaviour of the electronics. This is illustrated in Figure 6 for an example cell and a calibration run performed in medium gain (MG). The residuals deviate from a linear fit by about 0.3%; comparable deviations are observed in high-gain (HG) calibration runs. Theimplicationsofthisnon-linearityaretwofold.

The relative calibration of the HG and MG readouts is studied using 0.3 fb−1of data recorded in 2017 and 2018 using special conditions. For these data, the threshold to switch from HG to MG readout for the cells in the second layer was lowered, typically by a factor of three, such that almost all electrons from 𝑍-boson decays have at least the highest-energy cell in Layer 2 recorded in MG.

However, the interplay between 𝛼PSand the amount of material in front of the presampler produces a strong correlation between the corresponding uncertainties. In this paper, the determination of 𝛼PSis performed using muon candidates selected in the low-pile-up data sample. The muon energy deposits are insensitive to the material in front of the presampler, and therefore provide a direct measurement of the presampler energies. A high-purity sample of 𝑊→𝜇𝜈and𝑍→𝜇𝜇events is selected by requiring one or two isolated muons, with additional criteria for the transverse energy and mass, and in the 𝑍-boson case, the dimuon mass.

The invariant mass distribution is fitted in each ( |𝜂|,𝐸1/𝐸2) bin3, in the range[80,100]GeV, using the convolution of a Crystal Ball function and a Breit–Wigner distribution, while the small background in data is modelled by a second-order Chebyshev polynomial.

Theuncertaintyinthe energy scale is evaluated, as a function of |𝜂|and𝐸T, by reweighting the conversion fractions in a sample ofsimulatedsinglephotonsaccordingtothevaluesobtainedfromtheradiative 𝑍sampleinsimulationand data, respectively, and it is taken to be the relative difference of the energy responses. For photons with 𝐸T=60GeV, the uncertainty in the energy scale for unconverted photon candidates is about 0.02% in the barrel and 0.02%–0.13% in the endcaps. For converted photon candidates, it is about 0.12% in the barrel and smaller than 0.01% in the endcaps. For photons with lower energy the uncertainty increases significantly: for 𝐸T=15GeV, it amounts to 0.18% in the barrel and 0.08%–0.67% intheendcapsforunconvertedphotons. Forconvertedphotons,itbecomes0.69%–1.31%inthebarrel and 0.01%–0.1% in the endcaps. This systematic uncertainty is considered as a single source, correlated between converted and unconverted photons. 8.2 Out-of-cluster energy leakage mis-modelling Electronsandphotonsdepositabout1%to6%oftheirenergyoutsideoftheclusterusedinthereconstruction, dependingon 𝐸T,𝜂andtheparticletype.

Discrepancies between leakage modelling and data were observed in previous publications [1, 2], and the full sizeof thediscrepancies was consideredas a systematicuncertainty inthe photon energycalibration. The statistical power of the Run 2 data allows an improved mapping of the |𝜂|and𝐸Tdependence of this effect, and a correction is derived. The systematic variations, defined as above, reduce the residual uncertainty and allow a decrease in the corresponding calibration uncertainty by a factor of about two. 9 Electron and photon energy scale uncertainties The complete systematic uncertainty model contains 64 and 67 independent uncertainty variations

[1–3] from a combination of detector construction information and in situmeasurements, and are evaluated for up to nine |𝜂|regions. The uncertainty model for the cell readout non-linearity has been revised with respect to Ref. [2]. The presentanalysisconsidersseparatesourcesofuncertaintyforthetransitionsbetweenHighandMedium gain,andbetweenMediumandLowgaininLayer2. Inthepreviousanalyses,asingleuncertaintywas 25 used to cover both gain transitions. In addition, because of the improved strategy for the 𝛼12measurement (now also using an electron sample), the size of the uncertainty associated with the transition between High and Medium gain in Layer 1 was re-estimated for the current analysis. The corresponding sources of uncertainty are considered fully correlated in pseudorapidity. Thepresamplercalibrationandtheintercalibrationofthefirstandsecondaccordionlayersareestimated in nine and seven|𝜂|regions, respectively, with corresponding sources of uncertainty. Uncertainties corresponding to the 𝑍scale calibration, photon reconstruction and classification, pile-up modelling, and lateral shower shape development are all fully correlated in pseudorapidity. For the last category, an exception is the energy scale dependence on the shower width in 𝜂, where the region 1.52<|𝜂|<1.82is considered to be independent of the rest of the pseudorapidity interval. ThefulllistofsystematicuncertaintysourcesissummarizedinTable1. Theimpactofthemostsignificant ones is illustrated as a function of the electron or photon 𝐸Tin Figure 19, for two pseudorapidity values. The uncertainty in the energy resolution is shown in Figure 20 as a function of 𝐸T, for electrons and unconverted photons, at |𝜂|=0.3. Only theuncertainty relatedto the resolution correction (Section7) was updated in this analysis with respect to the descriptions provided in Refs. [1–3]. At high 𝐸T, the resolution uncertaintiesarelargerthanthosepresentedinRef.[2],wherefixed-sizeclusterswereusedforelectron and photon reconstruction.

On-shell Higgs boson production (only gluon-gluon fusion (ggF) is considered in the equations below, but the principle is the same in other production modes) is inversely proportional to the width: 𝜎on-shell 𝑔𝑔→𝐻→𝑍𝑍∼𝑔2 ggF𝑔2 HZZ 𝑚𝐻Γ𝐻. However, off-shell Higgs boson production has no width dependence: 𝜎off-shell 𝑔𝑔→𝐻→𝑍𝑍∼𝑔2 ggF𝑔2 HZZ 𝑚2 𝑍𝑍. Therefore, if the HZZ and effective 𝑔𝑔𝐻couplings in the two regimes (where the effective coupling is obtainedbytreatingthequarkloopasasinglevertex)haveaknownrelationship, Γ𝐻canbeextractedfrom the ratio of yields of observed Higgs boson events. Off-shell production is accessible in the 𝑍𝑍decay channel because the available phase space for the decay increases rapidly as the off-shell mass approaches the2𝑚𝑍threshold,counteractingtheexpecteddropintheproductionathighermasses [10–22],where 𝑚𝑍 is the mass of the 𝑍boson. Multiple searches for off-shell Higgs boson production have been carried out by the ATLAS and CMS collaborationsusingLHCRun1andRun2data[23–29]. Inpracticethesignalofoff-shellHiggsboson production is a deficit in 𝑔𝑔→𝑍𝑍or electroweak 𝑞¯𝑞→𝑍𝑍production, due to the negative interference between the off-shell Higgs boson process and the continuum background. Throughout this Letter, the notation𝑔𝑔→(𝐻∗→)𝑍𝑍isusedtorefertotheinclusiveprocessthatcombinestheHiggsbosonsignal 𝑔𝑔→𝐻∗→𝑍𝑍, the continuum background process 𝑔𝑔→𝑍𝑍, and their interference. Similarly, the notation𝑞¯𝑞→(𝐻∗→)𝑍𝑍+2𝑗referstotheinclusiveelectroweakprocessthatcombinestheprocesses 𝑞¯𝑞→𝐻∗→𝑍𝑍+2𝑗,𝑞¯𝑞→𝑍𝑍+2𝑗, and their interference. The corresponding leading-order Feynman diagrams for the signal and background processes are shown in Figures 1 and 2. Owing to the clean signature and accessible branching fractions, the four-lepton final states ( 4ℓand2ℓ2𝜈withℓ=𝑒or𝜇), originating from the decays of a pair of on-shell 𝑍bosons induced by a virtual Higgs boson, offer the main signal sensitivity. The latest CMS search [29], using 138fb−1in the 2ℓ2𝜈channel and 78fb−1in the 4ℓchannel, led to an observed (expected) detection significance of about 3.6𝜎(2.4) standard deviations ( 𝜎) for off-shell Higgs boson production and a measured Γ𝐻of3.2+2.4 −1.7 MeV.

The innermost layer of the pixel detector, the insertable B-layer [33], was installedbetweenRun1andRun2oftheLHC.Theinnerdetectorissurroundedbyathinsuperconducting solenoidprovidinga 2Tmagneticfield,andbyafinelysegmentedlead/liquid-argon(LAr)electromagnetic calorimetercoveringtheregion |𝜂|<3.2. Asteel/scintillator-tilehadroncalorimeterprovidescoverage in the central region |𝜂|<1.7. The endcap and forward regions, covering the pseudorapidity range 1.5 <|𝜂|<4.9, are instrumented with LAr electromagnetic and hadron calorimeters, with steel, copper, or tungsten as the absorber material. A muon spectrometer (MS) system incorporating large superconducting toroidal air-core magnets surrounds the calorimeters. Three layers of precision wire chambers provide muon tracking in the range of |𝜂|<2.7, while dedicated fast chambers are used for triggering in the region|𝜂|<2.4. Thetrigger system,composedoftwostages,was upgraded[34]beforeRun 2. Thefirst stage,implementedwithcustomhardware,usesinformationfromthecalorimetersandmuonchambers to select events from the 40 MHz bunch crossings at a maximum rate of 100 kHz. The second stage, called the high-level trigger (HLT), reduces the data acquisition rate to about 1 kHz on average. The HLT issoftware-basedandrunsreconstructionalgorithmssimilartothoseusedinofflinereconstruction. An extensivesoftwaresuite[35]isusedindatasimulation,inreconstructionandanalysisofrealandsimulated data, in detector operations, and in the trigger and data acquisition systems of the experiment. 3 Data and Monte Carlo simulation Theproton–proton( 𝑝𝑝)collisiondatausedinthissearchwerecollectedfrom2015to2018,corresponding to

MonteCarlo(MC)simulationisusedtopredictthenormalisationandeventkinematicsofthesignalprocess andsomeofthebackgrounds. Eventsamplesforeachprocesswerefirstproducedbyacorrespondingevent generator and then passed through detector simulation [36] within the Geant4framework [37]. Additional inelastic𝑝𝑝interactions (pile-up) modelled with Pythia8.186 [38] were overlaid on the simulated events to mimic the real collision events, and further corrections were applied to the simulated samples to match the pile-up conditions in the data. The lepton and jet momentum scale and resolution, and the lepton reconstruction,identification,isolationandtriggerefficienciesinthesimulationwerecorrectedtomatch those measured in data. Separate simulated samples were generated for each of the off-shell signal from ggF production, the 𝑔𝑔→𝑍𝑍background,andtheinclusiveproduction 𝑔𝑔→(𝐻∗→)𝑍𝑍,whichalsoincludestheinterference betweenthetwo. Theseloop-inducedprocessesweremodelledby Sherpav2.2.2[39]with OpenLoops [40– 42] at leading-order (LO) accuracy in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), with up to one additional parton in the final state, using the NNPDF3.0 parton distribution function (PDF) set [43].

Themerging withthepartonshowerwasperformedusingtheMEPS@NLOprescription[44]andthe Sherpabuilt-in algorithm was used for parton showering and hadronisation.

The total normalization of all three processes was then corrected tonext-to-next-to-next-to-leadingorder(N3LO)inQCDusingaconstantcorrectionof1.32,derivedfor the off-shell signal [47, 48]. The use of the same correction for all processes is justified as the

EW production of 𝑍𝑍and two jets, also denoted by 𝑞¯𝑞→(𝐻∗→)𝑍𝑍+2𝑗, contains inclusively the off-shell signal from VBF production, VH production, the non-Higgs boson EW 𝑍𝑍𝑗𝑗process, and their interferences. Those processes were modelled by MadGraph5_aMC@NLO [51] at LO QCD accuracyusingtheNNPDF3.0NLOPDFset[52]. Pythia8.244[38]wasusedforpartonshoweringand hadronisation with the A14 set of tuned parameters (tune) for the underlying event [53]. The 𝑡-channel exchange of the Higgs boson is treated as a contribution to the VBF signal process. The ggF- and VBF-induced contributions can be straightforwardly parameterised as a function of 𝜇off-shell, where the off-shell signal and the interference depend on 𝜇off-shelland√𝜇off-shell, respectively. More details of this parameterisation are given in Section 8. The𝑞¯𝑞→𝑍𝑍backgroundwassimulatedby Sherpav2.2.2with OpenLoops usingtheNNPDF3.0NNLO PDFset. ThematrixelementswerecalculatedtoNLOaccuracyinQCDfor0-and1-jetfinalstates, andto LOaccuracyfor2-and3-jetfinalstates. Themergingwiththe Sherpapartonshowerwasperformedusing theMEPS@NLOprescription[54]. NLOEWcorrectionscalculatedontopoftheLOQCDprediction were applied as a function of 𝑚𝑍𝑍for the 4ℓfinal state [55, 56], while the 𝑚𝑍𝑍-based corrections for the 2ℓ2𝜈channelwereaveragedfromtheadditive(NLOEW+NLOQCD)andmultiplicative(NLOEW × NLO QCD) approaches following Ref. [57]. A cross-check was performed in the 4ℓchannel, and the resultsofthetwoapproacheswerefoundtoagreewithintheiruncertainties,whiletheuncertaintiesofboth approaches (described in detail below) were also found to be similar. 5 The𝑊𝑍diboson events from both QCD and EW production, with the subsequent leptonic decays of both the𝑊and𝑍bosons, were simulated using Sherpawith a similar set-up to that of the 𝑞¯𝑞→𝑍𝑍 background. The 𝑊𝑍eventswiththe 𝑍bosondecayingleptonicallyandthe 𝑊bosondecayinghadronically weremodelledwith Sherpav2.2.1. Forthe 2ℓ2𝜈finalstate,thecontributionfrom 𝑊𝑊productionwas removed in the Sherpasimulation of the 𝑞¯𝑞→𝑍𝑍and𝑔𝑔→𝑍𝑍processes by requiring the charged leptons and the neutrinos to have different lepton flavours (the prediction was then scaled up by 1.5 to compensate). The 𝑞¯𝑞→𝑊𝑊and𝑔𝑔→𝑊𝑊processeswerethenmodelledwith Powheg Box v2[58] andSherpav2.2.2, respectively. The interference between 𝑊𝑊and𝑍𝑍production in the 2ℓ2𝜈final state is expected to be negligible in the phase space of the analysis [57] and was therefore not considered. The𝑍+jets background was simulated using the Sherpav2.2.1 event generator, where the matrix elements were calculated for up to
2304.01532v2.pdf|||two partons at NLO and four partons at LO. The 𝑍+jets events were normalised using the NNLO cross-sections [59]. The 𝑡¯𝑡background, as well as single-top (including s-channel, t-channel, and the dominant 𝑊𝑡component) production, were modelled using Powheg Box v2 interfaced toPythia8.230withtheA14tune. Thetotalcross-sectionsfor 𝑡¯𝑡productionandsingle-topproduction were normalised to the predictions at NNLO and NLO accuracy in QCD [60–62], respectively. The triboson backgrounds 𝑍𝑍𝑍,𝑊𝑍𝑍, and𝑊𝑊𝑍with fully leptonic decays were modelled with Sherpav2.2.2atNLOQCDaccuracy. The 𝑍𝑍𝑍→4ℓ+2𝑗processisincludedinthe 𝑞¯𝑞→(𝐻∗→)𝑍𝑍+2𝑗 sample described above. The simulation of 𝑡¯𝑡+𝑉production ( 𝑉=𝑊or𝑍) with at least one of the top quark decaying leptonically and the vector boson decaying inclusively was performed with MadGraph5_aMC@NLO interfacedto Pythia8.210forpartonshoweringandhadronisationwiththe A14 tune. The total cross-sections for the 𝑡¯𝑡+𝑉backgrounds were normalised to the NLO QCD and EW predictions from Ref. [63]. 4 Reconstruction of physics objects To describe the event signature and obtain a good signal-to-background ratio, this search relies on the successful reconstruction of collision vertices, electrons, muons, jets, ®𝐸miss T, as well as identification of jets containing𝑏-hadrons (𝑏-jets). The reconstruction is identical to that in Ref. [64], and briefly summarised as follows. Events are first required to have a collision vertex associated with at least two tracks each with transverse momentum𝑝T>0.5GeV. The vertex with the highest sum of 𝑝2 Tof the associated tracks is referred to as the primary vertex. Muons are primarily identified by tracks or segments (tracks using the hits of a single MS station) reconstructed in the MS and matched to tracks reconstructed in the ID, with exceptions in areas where the MSlackscoverage. Intheregion 2.5<|𝜂|<2.7,muonscanalsobeidentifiedbytracksfromthemuon spectrometeralone(standalone muons). In thegapregion( |𝜂|<0.1)ofthe MS,muonscanbe identified byatrackfromtheIDassociatedwithacompatiblecalorimeterenergydeposit(calorimeter-taggedmuons). Candidate muons are required to have 𝑝T>5GeVand|𝜂|<2.7, with the exception of calorimeter-tagged muons for which the 𝑝Tthreshold is raised to 15 GeV. Muons must satisfy the ‘loose’ identification criterion [65] in the 4ℓchannel with at most one standalone or calorimeter-tagged
2304.01532v2.pdf|||muon allowed per Higgs boson candidate. In the 2ℓ2𝜈channel muons are selected with |𝜂|<2.5and must satisfy the ‘medium’ identification criterion. Electrons are reconstructed from energy deposits in the electromagnetic calorimeter matched to a track in the ID. Candidate electrons must have 𝑝T>7GeVand|𝜂|<2.47, 6 andsatisfythe‘loose’and‘medium’identificationcriteria[66]inthe 4ℓand2ℓ2𝜈channels,respectively. All electrons and muons used in both channels must be isolated and satisfy the ‘FixedCutPFlowLoose’ isolation criteria [65, 66]. Furthermore, electrons (muons) are required to have associated tracks satisfying |𝑑0/𝜎𝑑0|<5(3)and|𝑧0×sin𝜃|<0.5mm, where𝑑0is the transverse impact parameter relative to the beamline,𝜎𝑑0isitsuncertainty,and 𝑧0isthezcoordinateofther- 𝜙impactpoint,definedrelativetothe primaryvertex. Theeventisrejectediftheminimumangularseparationbetweentwoleptonsis Δ𝑅ℓℓ<0.1, whereΔ𝑅ℓℓ=√︁ (Δ𝜙ℓℓ)2+(Δ𝜂ℓℓ)2. Jets are reconstructed from particle-flow objects [67] using the anti- 𝑘𝑡algorithm [68, 69] with radius parameter𝑅=0.4. Thejet-energyscaleiscalibratedusingsimulationandfurthercorrectedwithinsitu methods [70]. Candidate jets arerequired tohave 𝑝T>30GeVand|𝜂|<4.5. Ajet-vertextagger [71]is applied tojets with 𝑝T<60GeVand|𝜂|<2.4tosuppress jetsthat originatefrom pile-up. To mitigate the impact of pile-up jets in the forward region, another tagger, based on jet shapes and topological jet correlations[72],isusedtosuppressjetsoriginatingfromthepile-upwith 𝑝T<50GeVand2.5<|𝜂|<4.5. In addition,𝑏-jets are identified using a multivariate 𝑏-tagging algorithm [73] and events containing them are rejected. The chosen 𝑏-tagging algorithm has an efficiency of 85% for 𝑏-jets and a rejection factor of 33 against light-flavour jets, measured in 𝑡¯𝑡events [74]. The presence of neutrinos is identified using the missing transverse momentum vector ®𝐸miss T, which is computedastheoppositeofthevectorsumoftransversemomentaofalltheleptonsandjets,aswellasthe tracks originating from the primary vertex but not associated with any of the leptons or jets [75]. Missing transverse momentummay also arise from themismeasurement of the momentumof particles or jets. To avoidacceptingeventsduetothepresenceofthiskindoffake 𝐸miss T,thestatisticalsignificanceofthe 𝐸miss T, S(𝐸miss T), is used. S( 𝐸miss T) is calculated from the resolution information of the physics objects used in the 𝐸miss Treconstruction [76]. 5𝒁𝒁→4ℓanalysis The selectionof candidate eventsused in thesignal and controlregions of the 4ℓchannel closelyfollows that described in Ref [64]. The four-lepton invariant mass is required to be above the on-shell 𝑍𝑍 productionthreshold, 𝑚4ℓ>180GeV. Candidate 4ℓquadrupletsareformedbyselectingtwoopposite-sign, same-flavour dilepton pairs in
2304.01532v2.pdf|||each event. In the 4e and 4 𝜇channels, in which there are two possible pairings, the one that includes the lepton pair with mass closest to the Z boson mass is chosen. The 𝑝T thresholds for the three leading leptons are 20, 15 and 10 GeV, respectively. In each quadruplet, the lepton pair with mass closest to the 𝑍boson mass, 𝑚12, is referred to as the leading pair and required to have 50< 𝑚 12<106GeV. The sub-leading pair, 𝑚34, must satisfy 50< 𝑚 34<115GeVwhen𝑚4ℓ>190 GeV. Due to the increased probability of one off-shell Z boson at lower values of 𝑚4ℓ, the lower threshold for𝑚34decreases linearly to 45 GeV for 180<𝑚 4ℓ<190GeV. Three SRs are designed to provide sensitivity to both the EW and ggF production modes. The SRs are defined such that 𝑚4ℓis well above the Higgs boson mass, including only events with 𝑚4ℓ>220GeV.

These are used as inputs to the ME calculation,and,alongwiththetransversemomentumofthefour-leptonsystem,asinputstotheNNas well.

It has a larger branching fraction than the 4ℓchannel, but is subject to larger background contamination. Candidate events are preselected by requiring exactly two electrons or muons with opposite charges and 𝑝T>20GeV. The leading lepton must have 𝑝T>30GeVto surpass the trigger thresholds. To suppress the 𝑊𝑍background, events containing any additional lepton satisfying the loose identification criteria with 𝑝T>7GeVare rejected. Requiring the dilepton invariant mass ( 𝑚ℓℓ) to be between 76 and 106 GeVlargely reduces the contamination from the non-resonant- ℓℓbackground, originating from 𝑡¯𝑡, single-top (dominated by the𝑊𝑡process), and 𝑞¯𝑞→𝑊𝑊production. Events that satisfy this preselection are then further separatedintotheSRsandCRs. Tosuppresstheremainingbackgrounddominatedbythe 𝑍+jets and non-resonant- ℓℓprocesses, further selections based on 𝐸miss Tand the topology of the candidate events are applied. Candidate events are required to have 𝐸miss T>120GeVandS(𝐸miss T)>10. The azimuthal-angle difference between the dilepton system and ®𝐸miss T,Δ𝜙(®𝑝ℓℓ T,®𝐸miss T), must be larger than 2.5 radians, and the selected leptons must be close to each other, with the distance Δ𝑅ℓℓbelow 1.8. Furthermore, the azimuthal-angledifferencebetweenanyoftheselectedjetswith 𝑝T>100GeVand®𝐸miss Tmustbelarger than 0.4 radians to suppress events with poorly measured jet energies. Finally, events containing one or more𝑏-jets are rejected to further suppress the 𝑡¯𝑡and𝑊𝑡backgrounds. The selected events are then categorised into three SRs in the same way as for the 4ℓchannel. Theshapeandnormalisationofthemainbackgroundcontributionfrom 𝑞¯𝑞→𝑍𝑍productionareestimated from simulation, while in the combined result the overall normalisation

AsisshownlaterinTable4,the measured normalisations generally agree fairly well with the simulated ones, so this is a safe approach for developing the analysis in this final state.

(Foreaseof display, for the last four curves one plus the ratio is plotted.) 13 7 Systematic uncertainties The sources of systematic uncertainty impacting the analysis of both channels can be divided into two categories: uncertainties in the theoretical description of the signal and background processes and experimental uncertainties related to the detector response. The largest source of systematic uncertainties arises from the theoretical modelling of the signal and backgroundprocesses,includingthoserelatedtotheproductionofjetsassociatedwiththeHiggsboson. Experimentaluncertaintiesrelatedtothereconstructionofjetsarealsoprominentwhileotherexperimental uncertainties are generally small. To help understand the impact of the leading uncertainties, their relative size before the statistical fit for a specific process is provided in this section, with the largest uncertainties for the main processes in the signal and control regions summarized in Table 1. The impact of these uncertainties on the observed upper limits of 𝜇off-shellis given in Section 8. ThetheoreticaluncertaintiesarisefromthechoiceofPDF,fromthemissinghigher-ordercorrectionsin both QCD and EW perturbative calculations, and from the modelling of the parton shower. ThePDFuncertaintiesareevaluatedusingtheNNPDFprescriptionwithMCreplicas. ThePDFcovariance matrix between each channel of the analysis is estimated from the 100 replicas from the NNPDF3.0 NNLO set. Only the principal component of the covariance matrix has a non-negligible impact on the yields and it is usedas a representation of the PDF uncertainty includingits bin-by-bin correlations. The uncertaintiesduetomissinghigher-orderQCDcorrectionsareestimatedbyvaryingtherenormalisation and factorisation scales independently, ranging from a factor of one-half to two (excluding the cases in which one scale is varied down by one-half and the other up by two). For the 𝑞¯𝑞→𝑍𝑍background, the uncertainty is evaluated independently in bins of 𝑁jets. For the gluon-induced processes, including
2304.01532v2.pdf|||the signal, the 𝑔𝑔→𝑍𝑍background, and their interference, the missing higher-order uncertainties are evaluated by their impact on the respective NLO 𝐾-factors [81]. The uncertainties are increased in the kinematicregionsof theSRswherethe 𝐾-factorcalculationsare lesspreciseduetomissing effectsfrom on-shelltopquarksandhigh- 𝑝Tjets[27]: theuncertaintyisdoubledinthephasespacecontainingajet with𝑝T>150GeVand increasedby 50%for 𝑚𝑍𝑍around twicethe top-quarkmass. In boththe 4ℓand 2ℓ2𝜈channels, the uncertainty from missing higher order corrections in the 𝑞¯𝑞→𝑍𝑍background is oneofthelargestuncertainties,rangingfromafewpercentupto40%dependingonjetmultiplicityand observable bin. In both channels, the same uncertainty in the gluon–gluon processes ranges from 10% to 20%. The uncertainties due to missing higher-order EW corrections (HOEW) are considered for the main 𝑞¯𝑞→𝑍𝑍background and handled differently in the two channels. For the 2ℓ2𝜈channel, the difference in the NLO EW correction between the multiplicative and additive methods as a function of 𝑚𝑍𝑍is assigned astheuncertainty[57]. Thisuncertaintyrangesfrom1%toatmost20%ofthecross-sectiondepending onthebinsofobservables. Forthe 4ℓchannel,theNLOEWcorrectionsarecalculatedontopoftheLO QCD cross-section. Therefore, a specific prescription [82], also applied in Ref. [27], is used to derive theuncertaintytoaccountformissingNLOQCD+EWdiagrams. Astudyofthecompatibilitybetween the two methods inthe 4ℓchannel shows thatthe central values agreeto within afewpercent while the uncertainties have a similar size. The uncertainties due to the modelling of the parton shower and hadronisation play an important role in this search, as jet multiplicity, a key variable used todefine both the SRsand the CRs, is particularly sensitivetothemodellingofmatrixelements,partonshowering,andthemergingandmatchingbetween the two. The parton shower (PS) uncertainties are evaluated by varying resummation and matching scales 14 for the processes simulated with the Sherpagenerator. These variations for Sherpasamples are expected to further account for the shape uncertainties relating to missing high-order QCD effects beyond those from the usual QCD scale variations, i.e. migrations between jet bins. For those processes simulated with thePythiashower program, the uncertainty is assessed by varying the Pythiaconfigurations, such as theparametervaluesoftheA14tune,themulti-partonmodelsandthefinal-stateradiationmodels. For ggF production, the PS uncertainties are correlated between the signal and background processes. The uncertainties are split into shape and normalization components, with the latter being more significant. In the
2304.01532v2.pdf|||2ℓ2𝜈channel, the systematic uncertainties arising from the PS are parameterised using only the 𝑍𝑍 transverse momentum. In this channel, the PS uncertainty in the ggF processes is quite important: it is about25%intheyieldsandrangesfromafewpercenttoamaximumof15%intheobservableshapes. For the EW processes, this uncertainty reaches 15% in the yields and a few percent in the shapes. The PS uncertainties for the 𝑞¯𝑞→𝑍𝑍background are at percentage level for the bulk of observable bins but can reach up to 30% in some parts of the phase space. Inthe 4ℓchannel,theseuncertaintiesareparameterisedusingthe 4ℓinvariantmass, transversemomentum, andthekinematicsoftheleadingjets. NNsaretrainedtoestimatethedensityratiobetweenthenominaland the varied samples in this multi-dimensional space [83]. This novel method ensures a detailed description of the systematic uncertainty while reducing statistical fluctuations due to the interpolation provided by the differentiable NN. In the 4ℓchannel, PS uncertainties are the leading source of uncertainties for the gluon–gluon processes in the SRs, and are about 30% and 40% in the yields of the signal and the background. TheimpactofPSuncertaintiesintheshapeofobservablesisfoundtobenomorethan10%in the4ℓchannel. The PS uncertainties for the EW processes are less significant, ranging from a few percent to10%. ThePSuncertaintiesfortheQCD 𝑞¯𝑞→𝑍𝑍backgroundaregenerallysmaller,atpercentagelevel for most observable bins. Experimental systematic uncertainties are generally less important than the theoretical ones. However, uncertainties related to jet reconstruction are important in the 2ℓ2𝜈channel as mismeasurement of the jet energycanmimic 𝐸miss T. Themainjetuncertaintiesarethoseinthejetenergyscale(JES)andresolution (JER), which can amount to about 10% for processes in the EW SRs.

A binned likelihood function is constructed as a product of Poisson probability terms over all bins in all the SRs and CRs considered in the analysis, as introduced in Sections 5 and 6. The likelihood depends on the parameters of interest and a set of nuisance parameters 𝜃 that include the effects of systematic uncertainties and statistical uncertainties from the limited number of simulated events. They are constrained using Gaussian and Poisson terms, respectively. Different parameters of interest are used depending on the interpretation. The first interpretation explores two signal strength parameters ( 𝜇ggF off-shell=𝜅2 𝑔, off-shell𝜅2 𝑉, off-shelland𝜇EW off-shell=𝜅4 𝑉, off-shell) corresponding to the ggF- and EW-induced off-shell contributions, respectively. Here, 𝜅𝑔(𝜅𝑉) refers to the Higgs boson coupling to gluons (vector bosons) normalised to the SM prediction. In the second interpretation, a single off-shell signal-strength parameter ( 𝜇off-shell) is applied for all production modes, assuming that 𝜇ggF off-shell=𝜇EW off-shell=𝜇off-shell. Giventhesizeableinterferenceeffects,theoff-shellsignalcannotbetreatedindependentlyoftheinterfering

The expected number of events from the 𝑔𝑔→(𝐻∗→)𝑍𝑍process for a given𝜇ggF off-shell, referred as 𝜈ggF, can be obtained for a bin of the input distributions from the following parameterisation: 𝜈ggF(𝜇ggF off-shell,𝜽)=𝜇ggF off-shell·𝑛ggF S(𝜽)+√︃ 𝜇ggF off-shell·(𝑛ggF SBI(𝜽)−𝑛ggF S(𝜽)−𝑛ggF B(𝜽))+𝑛ggF B(𝜽) =(𝜇ggF off-shell−√︃ 𝜇ggF off-shell)·𝑛ggF S(𝜽)+√︃ 𝜇ggF off-shell·𝑛ggF SBI(𝜽)+(1−√︃ 𝜇ggF off-shell)·𝑛ggF B(𝜽) where𝑛ggF S,𝑛ggF Band𝑛ggF SBIrepresent the corresponding expected yields of the signal, the 𝑔𝑔→𝑍𝑍 background and the full 𝑔𝑔→(𝐻∗→)𝑍𝑍process, respectively. The expected number of events from the EW𝑞¯𝑞→(𝐻∗→)𝑍𝑍+2𝑗processforagiven 𝜇EW off-shellcanbemodelledsimilarly,andtheparameterisation is determined by using three simulation samples: that for the full process 𝑞¯𝑞→ (𝐻∗→)𝑍𝑍+2𝑗 with𝜇EW off-shellset to 1, that for the same process with 𝜇EW off-shellset to 10, and the non-Higgs boson EW 𝑞¯𝑞→𝑍𝑍+2𝑗background3.

The total normalisation of the 𝑞¯𝑞→𝑍𝑍background is left as a free parameter in the profile likelihood fit, separately foreachjet multiplicity. Threeparameters areintroduced inthe likelihoodmodel to constrain the normalisationof thisdominant background inboth finalstates, a normalizationfactor for 0-jetevents, 𝜇𝑞𝑞𝑍𝑍,andtwoadditionalparameterstorepresenttherelativecontributionsofhigherjetmultiplicities, 𝜇1𝑗 𝑞𝑞𝑍𝑍,and𝜇2𝑗 𝑞𝑞𝑍𝑍.

These parameters are largely constrained by the three CRs defined in Section 5, especially at high jet multiplicity. 3The values of 𝜇EW off-shell= 0, 1, and 10 are chosen for technical reasons involving the production of simulated samples but in principle any three numbers could be used. 17 The normalisations of the 𝑊𝑍,𝑍+ jets and non-resonant- ℓℓbackgrounds are also obtained from the simultaneous fit, using the dedicated control regions described in Section 6.

The expected curve is flatter than the observed due to the effect of a downward fluctuation in the data and the parabolic shape of the yield versus 𝜇curve, which arises due to the√𝜇dependence of the interference. In particular, for electroweak production, the expected yield is minimized at the value of 𝜇=0.8, close to the value𝜇=1at which the expected −2 ln𝜆curve is minimized. In this case, a downward fluctuation in the data, observed for this production mode, does not appreciably move the minimum, because a lower yieldcannotreducethebest-fitvalueof 𝜇below0.8. Instead,theloweryieldmakesvaluesfurtherfrom the minimum less likely, thus narrowing the profile likelihood.

The results of statistically independent searches for Higgs bosons produced in conjunction with a top quark-antiquark pair and decaying to pairs of W bosons, Z bosons, photons, tleptons, or bottom quark jets are com- bined to maximize sensitivity. An excess of events is observed, with a signiﬁcance of 5.2 standard deviations, over the expectation from the background-only hypothesis. The corresponding expected signiﬁcance from the standard model for a Higgs boson mass of 125.09 GeV is 4.2 standard deviations.

In particular, the 13 TeV data collected so far by the ATLAS [4] and CMS [5] experiments have led to improved constraints on the couplings of the Higgs boson compared to those performed at the lower energies [6], permitting more precise consistency checks with the predictions of the standard model (SM) of particle physics [7–9]. Nonetheless, not all properties of the Higgs boson have been established, in part because
1804.02610v2.pdf|||of insufﬁciently large data sets. The lack of statis- tical precision can be partially overcome by combining the results of searches in different decay channels of the Higgs boson and at different CM energies. Among the properties that are not yet well established is the tree-level coupling of Higgs bosons to top quarks. In this Letter, we present a combination of searches for the Higgs boson (H) produced in as- sociation with a top quark-antiquark pair (t t), based on data collected with the CMS detector. Results from data collected atps=13 TeV [10–14] are combined with analogous results fromps=7 and 8 TeV [15]. As a result of this combination, we establish the observation of t tH production. This constitutes the ﬁrst conﬁrmation of the tree-level coupling of the Higgs boson to top quarks. A top quark decays almost exclusively to a bottom quark and a W boson, with the W boson subsequently decaying either to a quark and an antiquark or to a charged lepton and its asso- ciated neutrino. The Higgs boson exhibits a rich spectrum of decay modes that includes the decay to a bottom quark-antiquark pair, a t+t lepton pair, a photon pair, and combinations of quarks and leptons from the decay of intermediate on- or off-shell W and Z bosons. Thus, ttH production gives rise to a wide variety of ﬁnal-state event topologies, which we consider in our analyses and in the combination of results presented below. In the SM, the masses of elementary fermions are accounted for by introducing a minimal set of Yukawa interactions, compatible with gauge invariance, between the Higgs and fermion ﬁelds. Following the spontaneous breaking of electroweak symmetry [16–21], charged fermions of ﬂavor f couple to H with a strength yfproportional to the mass mfof those fermions, namely yf=mf/v, where v246 GeV
1804.02610v2.pdf|||is the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs ﬁeld. Measure- ments of the Higgs boson decay rates to down-type fermions ( tleptons and bottom quarks) agree with the SM predictions within their uncertainties [22, 23]. However, the top quark Yukawa coupling ( yt) cannot be similarly tested from the measurement of a decay rate since on-shell top quarks are too heavy to be produced in Higgs boson decay. Instead, constraints onytcan be obtained through the measurement of the pp !ttH production process. Exam- ple tree-level Feynman diagrams for this process are shown in Fig. 1. To date t tH production has eluded deﬁnite observation, although ﬁrst evidence has been recently reported by the AT- LAS [24] and CMS [10] Collaborations. The overall agreement observed between the SM predictions and data for the rate of Higgs boson production through gluon-gluon fusion and for the H !ggdecay mode [6] suggests that the Higgs boson coupling to top quarks is SM-like, since the quantum loops in these pro- cesses include top quarks. However, non-SM particles in the loops could introduce terms that compensate for, and thus mask, other deviations from the SM. A measurement of the produc- tion rate of the tree-level t tH process can provide evidence for, or against, such new-physics contributions. The central feature of the CMS apparatus is a superconducting solenoid of 6 m internal diame- ter, providing a magnetic ﬁeld of 3.8 T. Within the solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter, and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter, each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections. Forward calorimeters extend 2 g gH t_t t t_Hg g H t_t q q_ Figure 1: Example tree-level Feynman diagrams for the pp !ttH production process, with g a gluon, q a

For the present study, we consider Higgs boson decays to a pair of W bosons, Z bosons, photons, tleptons, or bottom quark jets. the pseudorapidity coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. Muons are detected in gas-ionization chambers embedded in the steel ﬂux-return yoke outside the solenoid. A detailed description of the CMS detector can be found in Ref. [5]. Events of interest are selected using a two-tiered trigger system [25] based on custom hardware processors and a farm of commercial processors running a version of the full reconstruction software optimized for speed. Ofﬂine, a particle-ﬂow algorithm [26] is used to reconstruct and identify each particle in an event based on a combination of information from the various CMS subdetectors. Additional identiﬁcation criteria are employed to improve purities and deﬁne the ﬁnal samples of candidate electrons, muons, hadronically decaying tleptons ( th) [27, 28], and photons. Jets are reconstructed from particle-ﬂow candidates using the anti- kTclustering algorithm [29] implemented in the F ASTJETpackage [30]. Multivariate algorithms [31, 32] are used to identify (tag) jets arising from the hadronization of bottom quarks (b jets) and discrim- inate against gluon and light ﬂavor quark jets. The algorithms utilize observables related to the long lifetimes of hadrons containing b quarks and the relatively larger particle multiplicity and mass of b jets compared to light ﬂavor quark jets. The thidentiﬁcation is based on the reconstruction of the hadronic tdecay modes t !h nt, h p0nt, h p0p0nt, and h h+h nt (plus the charge conjugate reactions), where hdenotes either a charged pion or kaon. More details about the reconstruction procedures are given in Refs. [10–15]. The 13 TeV data employed for the current study were collected in 2016 and correspond to an integrated luminosity of up to 35.9 fb 1[33].
1804.02610v2.pdf|||The 7 and 8 TeV data, collected in 2011 and 2012, correspond to integrated luminosities of up to 5.1 and 19.7 fb 1[34], respectively. The 13 TeV analyses are improved relative to the 7 and 8 TeV studies in that they employ triggers with higher efﬁciencies, contain improvements in the reconstruction and background-rejection methods, and use more precise theory calculations to describe the signal and the background processes. For the 7, 8 and 13 TeV data, the theoretical calculations of Ref. [35] for Higgs boson production cross sections and branching fractions are used to normalize the expected signal yields. The event samples are divided into exclusive categories depending on the multiplicity and kinematic properties of reconstructed electrons, muons, thcandidates, photons, jets, and tagged b jets in an event. Samples of simulated events based on Monte Carlo event generators, with simulation of the detector response based on the G EANT 4 [36] suite of programs, are used to evaluate the detector acceptance and optimize the event selection for each category. In the anal- ysis of data, the background is, in general, evaluated from data control regions. When this is not feasible, either because the background process has a very small cross section or a control region depleted of signal events cannot be identiﬁed, the background is evaluated from sim- ulation with a systematic uncertainty assigned to account for the known model dependence. Multivariate algorithms [37–41] based on deep neural networks, boosted decision trees, and matrix element calculations are used to reduce backgrounds. 3 1 −01234567H ttµCombined13 TeV7+8 TeV)bH(btt)-τ+τH(tt)γγH(ttH(ZZ*)ttH(WW*)tt (13 TeV)-1 (8 TeV) + 35.9 fb-1 (7 TeV) + 19.7 fb-15.1 fbCMS Observed syst) ⊕ (stat σ1± (syst) σ1± syst) ⊕ (stat σ2± Figure 2: Best ﬁt value of the t tH signal strength modiﬁer mttH, with its 1 and 2 standard devia-

The Higgs boson mass is taken to be 125.09 GeV. For the H !ZZ decay mode, mttHis constrained to be positive to prevent the corresponding event yield from becoming negative. The SM expectation is shown as a dashed vertical line. At 13 TeV, we search for t tH production in the H !bb decay mode by selecting events with at least three tagged b jets and with zero leptons [11], one lepton [12], or an opposite-sign lepton pair [12], where “lepton” refers to an electron or muon candidate. A search for t tH production in the H !ggdecay mode is performed in events with two reconstructed photons in combination with reconstructed electrons or muons, jets, and tagged b jets [13]. The signal yield is extracted from a ﬁt to the diphoton invariant mass spectrum. Events with combinations of jets and tagged b jets and with two same-sign leptons, three leptons, or four leptons are used to search for t tH production in the H !t+t , WW, or ZZdecay modes [10, 14], where in this case “lepton” refers to an electron, muon, or thcandidate (the asterisk denotes an off-shell particle). The searches in the different decay channels are statistically independent from each other. Analogous searches have been performed with the 7 and 8 TeV data [15]. The presence of a t tH signal is assessed by performing a simultaneous ﬁt to the data from the different decay modes, and also from the different CM energies as described below. A detailed description of the statistical methods can be found in Ref. [42]. The test statistic qis deﬁned

Systematic uncertainties are incorporated through the use of nuisance parameters treated according to the frequentist paradigm. The ratio between the normalization of the t tH production process and its SM expectation [35], deﬁned as the signal strength modiﬁer mttH, is a freely ﬂoating parameter in the ﬁt. The SM expectation is evaluated assuming the combined ATLAS and CMS value for the mass of the Higgs boson, which is 125.09 GeV [43]. We consider the ﬁve Higgs boson decay modes with the largest expected event yields, namely H !WW, ZZ,gg,t+t , and b b. Other Higgs boson decay modes and production processes, including pp !tH+X (or tH+X), with X a light ﬂavor quark or W boson, are treated as backgrounds and normalized using the predicted SM cross sections, subject to the corresponding uncertainties.

The principal sources of experimental systematic uncertainty in the overall result for mttHstem from the uncertainty in the lepton and b jet identiﬁcation efﬁciencies and in the thand jet energy scales. The background theory systematic uncertainty is dominated by modeling uncertainties in tt production in association with a W boson, a Z boson, or a pair of b or c quark jets. The dominant contribution to the signal theory systematic uncertainty arises from the ﬁnite accu- racy in the SM prediction for the t tH cross section because of missing higher order terms and uncertainties in the proton parton density functions [35]. To highlight the excess of data over the expectation from the background-only hypothesis, we classify each event that enters the combined ﬁt by the ratio S/B, where Sand Bare the expected post-ﬁt signal (with mttH=1) and background yields, respectively, in each bin of the distributions considered in the combination.

The measured production rate is consistent with the standard model prediction within one standard deviation. In addition to comprising the ﬁrst observation of a new Higgs boson pro- duction mechanism, this measurement establishes the tree-level coupling of the Higgs boson to the top quark, and hence to an up-type quark. Acknowledgments We congratulate our colleagues in the CERN accelerator departments for the excellent perfor- mance of the LHC and thank the technical and administrative staffs at CERN and at other CMS institutes for their contributions to the success of the CMS effort. In addition, we grate- fully acknowledge the computing centers and personnel of the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid for delivering so effectively the computing infrastructure essential to our analyses.

The detector operates at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. It was conceived to study proton-proton (and lead- lead) collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 14 TeV (5.5 TeV nucleon-nucleon) and at luminosi- ties up to 1034cm 2s 1(1027cm 2s 1). At the core of the CMS detector sits a high-magnetic- ﬁeld and large-bore superconducting solenoid surrounding an all-silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead-tungstate scintillating-crystals electromagnetic calorimeter, and a brass-scintillator sampling hadron calorimeter. The iron yoke of the ﬂux-return is instrumented with four stations of muon detectors covering most of the 4p solid angle. Forward sampling calorimeters extend the pseudo- rapidity coverage to high values (j hj5) assuring very good hermeticity. The overall dimensions of the CMS detector are a length of 21.6 m, a diameter of 14.6 m and a total weight of 12500

The LHC is presently being constructed in the already existing 27-km LEP tunnel in the Geneva region. It will yield head-on collisions of two pro- ton (ion) beams of 7 TeV (2.75 TeV per nucleon) each, with a design luminosity of 1034cm 2s 1 (1027cm 2s 1). This paper provides a description of the design and construction of the CMS detec- tor. CMS is installed about 100 metres
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||underground close to the French village of Cessy, between Lake Geneva and the Jura mountains. The prime motivation of the LHC is to elucidate the nature of electroweak symmetry break- ing for which the Higgs mechanism is presumed to be responsible. The experimental study of the Higgs mechanism can also shed light on the mathematical consistency of the Standard Model at energy scales above about 1 TeV . Various alternatives to the Standard Model invoke new symme- tries, new forces or constituents. Furthermore, there are high hopes for discoveries that could pave the way toward a uniﬁed theory. These discoveries could take the form of supersymmetry or extra dimensions, the latter often requiring modiﬁcation of gravity at the TeV scale. Hence there are many compelling reasons to investigate the TeV energy scale. The LHC will also provide high-energy heavy-ion beams at energies over 30 times higher than at the previous accelerators, allowing us to further extend the study of QCD matter under extreme conditions of temperature, density, and parton momentum fraction (low-x ). Hadron colliders are well suited to the task of exploring new energy domains, and the region of 1 TeV constituent centre-of-mass energy can be explored if the proton energy and the luminosity are high enough. The beam energy and the design luminosity of the LHC have been chosen in order to study physics at the TeV energy scale. A wide range of physics is potentially possible with the seven-fold increase in energy and a hundred-fold increase in integrated luminosity over the previous hadron collider experiments. These conditions also require a very careful design of the detectors. The total proton-proton cross-section atps=14 TeV is expected to be roughly 100 mb. At design luminosity the general-purpose detectors will therefore observe an event rate of approxi- mately 109inelastic events/s. This
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||leads to a number of formidable experimental challenges. The online event selection process (trigger ) must reduce the huge rate to about 100 events/s for storage and subsequent analysis. The short time between bunch crossings, 25 ns, has major implications for the design of the read-out and trigger systems. – 1 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004At the design luminosity, a mean of about 20 inelastic collisions will be superimposed on the event of interest. This implies that around 1000 charged particles will emerge from the interaction region every 25 ns. The products of an interaction under study may be confused with those from other interactions in the same bunch crossing. This problem clearly becomes more severe when the response time of a detector element and its electronic signal is longer than 25 ns. The effect of this pile-up can be reduced by using high-granularity detectors with good time resolution, resulting in low occupancy. This requires a large number of detector channels. The resulting millions of detector electronic channels require very good synchronization. The large ﬂux of particles coming from the interaction region leads to high radiation levels, requiring radiation-hard detectors and front-end electronics. The detector requirements for CMS to meet the goals of the LHC physics programme can be summarised as follows: • Good muon identiﬁcation and momentum resolution over a wide range of momenta and angles, good dimuon mass resolution ( 1% at 100 GeV), and the ability to determine un- ambiguously the charge of muons with p<1 TeV; • Good charged-particle momentum resolution and reconstruction efﬁciency in the inner tracker. Efﬁcient triggering and ofﬂine tagging of t’s and b-jets, requiring pixel detectors close to the interaction region; • Good electromagnetic energy resolution, good diphoton and dielectron mass resolution ( 1% at 100 GeV), wide geometric coverage, p0rejection, and
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||efﬁcient photon and lepton isolation at high luminosities; • Good missing-transverse-energy and dijet-mass resolution, requiring hadron calorimeters with a large hermetic geometric coverage and with ﬁne lateral segmentation. The design of CMS, detailed in the next section, meets these requirements. The main distin- guishing features of CMS are a high-ﬁeld solenoid, a full-silicon-based inner tracking system, and a homogeneous scintillating-crystals-based electromagnetic calorimeter. The coordinate system adopted by CMS has the origin centered at the nominal collision point inside the experiment, the y-axis pointing vertically upward, and the x-axis pointing radially inward toward the center of the LHC. Thus, the z-axis points along the beam direction toward the Jura mountains from LHC Point 5. The azimuthal angle fis measured from the x-axis in the x-yplane and the radial coordinate in this plane is denoted by r. The polar angle qis measured from the z- axis. Pseudorapidity is deﬁned as h= lntan( q=2). Thus, the momentum and energy transverse to the beam direction, denoted by pTandET, respectively, are computed from the xandycomponents. The imbalance of energy measured in the transverse plane is denoted by Emiss T. 1.1 General concept An important aspect driving the detector design and layout is the choice of the magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration for the measurement of the momentum of muons. Large bending power is needed – 2 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004 Compact Muon S olenoidPixel DetectorSilicon Tracker Very-forward Calorimeter ElectromagneticCalorimeterHadronCalorimeterPreshower MuonDetectorsSuperconducting SolenoidFigure 1.1: A perspective view of the CMS detector. to measure precisely the momentum of high-energy charged particles. This forces a choice of superconducting technology for the magnets. The overall layout of CMS [1] is shown in ﬁgure 1.1. At the heart of CMS sits a 13-m- long, 6-m-inner-diameter, 4-T superconducting solenoid providing a large bending power (12 Tm) before the muon bending angle is measured by
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||the muon system. The return ﬁeld is large enough to saturate 1.5 m of iron, allowing 4 muon stations to be integrated to ensure robustness and full geometric coverage. Each muon station consists of several layers of aluminium drift tubes (DT) in the barrel region and cathode strip chambers (CSC) in the endcap region, complemented by resistive plate chambers (RPC). The bore of the magnet coil is large enough to accommodate the inner tracker and the calorimetry inside. The tracking volume is given by a cylinder of 5.8-m length and 2.6-m di- ameter. In order to deal with high track multiplicities, CMS employs 10 layers of silicon microstrip detectors, which provide the required granularity and precision. In addition, 3 layers of silicon pixel detectors are placed close to the interaction region to improve the measurement of the impact parameter of charged-particle tracks, as well as the position of secondary vertices. The expected muon momentum resolution using only the muon system, using only the inner tracker, and using both sub-detectors is shown in ﬁgure 1.2. The electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) uses lead tungstate (PbWO 4) crystals with cov- erage in pseudorapidity up to jhj<3:0. The scintillation light is detected by silicon avalanche photodiodes (APDs) in the barrel region and vacuum phototriodes (VPTs) in the endcap region. A preshower system is installed in front of the endcap ECAL for p0rejection.

The scintillation light is converted by wavelength-shifting (WLS) ﬁbres embedded in the scintillator tiles and channeled to photodetectors via clear ﬁbres. This light is detected by photodetectors (hybrid photodiodes, or HPDs) that can provide gain and operate in high axial magnetic ﬁelds. This central calorimetry is complemented by a tail-catcher in the bar- rel region (HO) ensuring that hadronic showers are sampled with nearly 11 hadronic interaction lengths. Coverage up to a pseudorapidity of 5.0 is provided by an iron/quartz-ﬁbre calorime- ter. The Cerenkov light emitted in the quartz ﬁbres is detected by photomultipliers. The forward calorimeters ensure full geometric coverage for the measurement of the transverse energy in the event. An even higher forward coverage is obtained with additional dedicated calorimeters (CAS- TOR, ZDC, not shown in ﬁgure 1.1) and with the TOTEM [2] tracking detectors. The expected jet transverse-energy resolution in various pseudorapidity regions is shown in ﬁgure 1.4. The CMS detector is 21.6-m long and has a diameter of 14.6 m. It has a total weight of 12500 t. The ECAL thickness, in radiation lengths, is larger than 25 X0, while the HCAL thickness, in interaction lengths, varies in the range 7–11 lI(10–15 lIwith the HO included), depending on h. – 4 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004 E (GeV)0 50 100 150 200 250s(E)/E (%) 00.20.40.60.811.21.4 S= 2.8 (%) (GeV) N= 0.12 (GeV) C= 0.3 (%)1 2_Figure 1.3: ECAL energy resolution, s(E)=E, as a function of electron energy

The ﬂux is re- turned through a 10 000-t yoke comprising 5 wheels and 2 endcaps, composed of three disks each (ﬁgure 1.1). The distinctive feature of the 220-t cold mass is the 4-layer winding made from a stabilised reinforced NbTi conductor. The ratio between stored energy and cold mass is high (11.6 KJ/kg), causing a large mechanical deformation (0.15%) during energising, well beyond the values of previous solenoidal detector magnets. The parameters of the CMS magnet are summarised in table 2.1. The magnet was designed to be assembled and tested in a surface hall (SX5), prior to being lowered 90 m below ground to its ﬁnal position in the experimental cavern. After provi- sional connection to its ancillaries, the CMS Magnet has been fully and successfully tested and commissioned in SX5 during autumn 2006. 2.2 Main features of the magnet components 2.2.1 Superconducting solenoid The superconducting
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||solenoid (see an artistic view in ﬁgure 2.1and a picture taken during assembly in the vertical position in SX5 in ﬁgure 2.2) presents three new features with respect to previous detector magnets: • Due to the number of ampere-turns required for generating a ﬁeld of 4 T (41.7 MA-turn), the winding is composed of 4 layers, instead of the usual 1 (as in the Aleph [7] and Delphi [8] coils) or maximum 2 layers (as in the ZEUS [9] and BaBar [10] coils); • The conductor, made from a Rutherford-type cable co-extruded with pure aluminium (the so-called insert), is mechanically reinforced with an aluminium alloy; • The dimensions of the solenoid are very large (6.3-m cold bore, 12.5-m length, 220-t mass). For physics reasons, the radial extent of the coil (DR) had to be kept small, and thus the CMS coil is in effect a “thin coil” (DR=R 0:1). The hoop strain (e ) is then determined by the – 6 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004 Figure 2.1: General artistic view of the 5 modules composing the cold mass inside the cryostat, with details of the supporting system (vertical, radial and longitudinal tie rods). magnetic pressure (P =B2 0 2m0=6:4 MPa), the elastic modulus of the material (mainly aluminium with Y= 80 GPa) and the structural thickness (DR s= 170 mm i.e., about half of the total cold mass thickness), according toPR DRs=Ye, giving e=1:510 3. This value is high compared to the strain of previous existing detector magnets. This can be better viewed looking at a more signiﬁcant ﬁgure of merit, i.e. the E=Mratio directly proportional to the mechanical hoop strain according toE M=PR 2DR sdDRs DR=DRs DRYe 2d, where dis the mass density. Figure 2.3shows the values of E=Mas function of stored energy for several detector magnets. The CMS
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||coil is distinguishably far from other detector magnets when combining stored energy and E=Mratio (i.e. mechanical deformation). In order to provide the necessary hoop strength, a large fraction of the CMS coil must have a structural function. To limit the shear stress level inside the winding and prevent cracking the insulation, especially at the border deﬁned by the winding and the external mandrel, the structural material cannot be too far from the current-carrying elements (the turns). On the basis of these considerations, the innovative design of the CMS magnet uses a self-supporting conductor, by including in it the structural material. The magnetic hoop stress (130 MPa) is shared between the layers (70%) and the support cylindrical mandrel (30%) rather than being taken by the outer mandrel only, as was the case in the previous generation of thin detector solenoids. A cross section of the cold mass is shown in ﬁgure 2.4. The construction of a winding using a reinforced conductor required technological develop- ments for both the conductor [11] and the winding. In particular, for the winding many problems had to be faced mainly related to the mandrel construction [12], the winding method [13], and the module-to-module mechanical coupling. The modular concept of the cold mass had to face the problem of the module-to-module mechanical connection. These interfaces (ﬁgure 2.5) are critical – 7 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004Table 2.1: Main parameters of the CMS magnet.

These displacements can be partially converted into heat, causing a premature quench.

The central barrel supports the vacuum chamber of the superconducting coil. At the rear, one of the closing end cap disks is visible. 2.2.2 Yoke The yoke (ﬁgure 2.6) is composed of 11 large elements, 6 endcap disks,
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||and 5 barrel wheels, whose weight goes from 400 t for the lightest up to 1920 t for the central wheel, which includes the coil and its cryostat. The easy relative movement of these elements facilitates the assembly of the sub-detectors. To displace each element a combination of heavy-duty air pads plus grease pads has been chosen. This choice makes the system insensitive to metallic dust on the ﬂoor and allows transverse displacements. Two kinds of heavy-duty high-pressure air pads with a capacity of either 250 t (40 bars) or 385 t (60 bars) are used. This is not favourable for the ﬁnal approach when closing the detector, especially for the YE1 endcap that is protruding into the vacuum tank. A special solution has been adopted: for the last 100 mm of approach, ﬂat grease-pads (working pressure 100 bar) have been developed in order to facilitate the ﬁnal closing of the detector. Once they touch the axially-installed z-stops, each element is pre-stressed with 100 t to the adjacent element. This assures good contact before switching on the magnet. In the cavern the elements will be moved on the 1.23% inclined ﬂoor by a strand jacking hydraulic system that ensures safe operation for uphill pulling as well as for downhill pushing by keeping a retaining force. The maximum movements possible in the cavern are of the order of 11 meters; this will take one hour. To easily align the yoke elements, a precise reference system of about 70 points was installed in the surface assembly hall. The origin of the reference system is the geometrical center of the coil. The points were made after loading the coil cryostat with the inner detectors, the hadronic barrel in particular which weights 1000 t. A mark on the ﬂoor was made showing the position

Finally, all the elements were aligned with an accuracy of 2 mm with respect to the ideal axis of the coil. – 11 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004 Figure 2.7: The electrical scheme of the magnet with the protection circuit. One of the main components of the protection is the dump resistor, made of three elements. 2.2.3 Electrical scheme The CMS solenoid can be represented as a 14 H inductance mutually coupled with its external mandrel. This inductive coupling allows for the so-called quench back effect, as the eddy currents, induced in the external mandrel at the trigger of a current fast discharge, heat up the whole coil above the superconducting critical temperature. This is the fundamental basis of the protection system, which, in case of a superconducting to resistive transition of the coil, aims at keeping the lowest possible thermal gradients and temperature increase in the superconducting windings, and prevents the occurrence of local overheating, hence reducing the thermal stresses inside the winding. A diagram of the powering circuit with protection is shown in ﬁgure 2.7. A bipolar thyristor power converter rated at 520 kW with passive L-C ﬁlters is used to power the CMS solenoid. It covers a range of voltages from +26 V to -23 V , with a nominal DC current of 19.1 kA. In case of a sudden switch off of the power converter, the current decays naturally in the bus-bar resistance and through the free-wheel thyristors until the opening of the main breakers. Inside the power converter, an assembly of free-wheel thyristors, mounted on naturally air-cooled heat sinks, is installed. In case of non-opening of the main switch breakers, the thyristors are rated to support 20 kA DC for 4
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||minutes. The current discharge is achieved by disconnecting the electrical power source by the use of two redundant 20 kA DC normally-open switch breakers, leaving the solenoid in series with a resistor, in a L-R circuit conﬁguration. The stored magnetic energy is therefore extracted by thermal dissipation in the so-called dump resistor. This resistor is external to the solenoid cryostat and is designed to work without any active device. It is positioned – 12 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004outdoors taking advantage of natural air convection cooling. The fast discharge (FD) is automat- ically triggered by hardwired electronics only in case of a superconductive-to-resistive transition, a so-called quench, and for unrecoverable faults which require fast current dumping. The FD time constant is about 200 s. An emergency FD button is also available to the operator in case of need. As the coil becomes resistive during the FD, energy is dissipated inside the coil, which heats up. As a consequence, this necessitates a post-FD cool-down of the coil. The FD is performed on a 30 mW dump resistor, as a compromise to keep the dump voltage lower than 600 V , and to limit the coil warm-up and subsequent cool-down time. For faults involving the 20 kA power source, a slow discharge (SD) is triggered through hardwired electronics on a 2 mW dump resistor. The SD current evolution is typically exponential, and its time constant is 7025 s, but the coil stays in the superconducting state as the heat load, about 525 W, is fully absorbed by the cooling refrigerator. For current lower than 4 kA, a FD is performed in any case, as the heat load is small enough for the refrigerator. The same resistor is used in both cases for the FD and the SD, using normally open contactors, leaving
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||the dump resistor modules either in series (FD) or in parallel (SD). For other cases, and depending on the alarms, the coil current can be adjusted by the operator, or ramped down to zero, taking advantage of the two-quadrant converter. 2.2.4 Vacuum system The vacuum system has been designed to provide a good insulation inside the 40 m3vacuum volume of the coil cryostat. It consists of 2 double-primary pumping stations, equipped with 2 rotary pumps and 2 Root’s pumps, that provide the fore vacuum to the two oil diffusion pumps located at the top of CMS and connected to the coil cryostat via the current leads chimney and the helium phase separator. The rotary pumps have a capacity of 280 m3/h while the two Root’s pumps have a ﬂow of 1000 m3/h. The biggest oil diffusion pump, installed via a DN 400 ﬂange on the current leads chimney, has a nominal ﬂow of 8000 l/s at 10 4mbar of fore vacuum. The smallest one delivers 3000 l/s at the phase separator. 2.2.5 Cryogenic plant The helium refrigeration plant for CMS is speciﬁed for a cooling capacity of 800 W at 4.45 K, 4500 W between 60 and 80 K, and simultaneously 4 g/s liquefaction capacity. The primary compressors of the plant have been installed, in their ﬁnal position, while the cold box, as well as the intermedi- ate cryostat which interfaces the phase separator and the thermo-syphon, were moved underground after the completion of the magnet test. These components were commissioned with the help of a temporary heat load of 6.5 kW that simulated the coil cryostat which was not yet available. The performance of the cold box has been measured in cool-down mode and in nominal and operation mode. 2.2.6 Other ancillaries •Current leads. The two 20-kA current leads are

The magnet is connected to the cryoplant (through the proximity cryogenics), the vacuum and the power systems. to hold a current of 20 kA for 5 minutes, followed by a FD without any damage, as the temperature at the hot spot stays below 400 K [14]. •Grounding circuit. The grounding circuit is connected across the solenoid terminals. It ﬁxes the coil circuit potential, through a 1 kW resistor, dividing by two the potential to ground. The winding insulation quality is monitored by continuously measuring the leakage current through a 10 Wgrounding resistor. •Quench detection system. The quench detection system is a key element of the Magnet Safety System (MSS). The role of the quench detection system is to detect a resistive voltage be- tween two points of the coil, whose value and duration are compared to adjustable thresholds. The voltage taps are protected by 4.7 kW, 6 W resistors. There are 2 redundant systems, with resistor bridge detectors and differential detectors. For each system, there are 5 detectors. Each resistor bridge detector spans two modules and one detector spans the whole solenoid. Each coil module is compared with two other modules through two differential detectors. 2.3 Operating test The magnet and all its ancillaries were assembled for testing in SX5 and ready for cool-down in January 2006. Figure 2.8shows the test layout. – 14 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004 Figure 2.9: Graph of the coil minimum and maximum temperatures during the

Figure 2.9shows the cool-down curve. The only glitch was due to an overpressure on a safety release valve that stopped cooling for one night before the system was restarted. One important aspect monitored during the cool-down was the amount of coil shrinkage. In order to explain this point, we refer to the coil suspension system inside the cryostat (ﬁgure 2.1), made of longitudinal, vertical, and axial tie-rods in Ti alloy. The magnet is supported by 2 9 longitudinal tie rods, 4 vertical tie rods, and 8 radial tie rods. The tie rods are equipped with compensated strain gauges to measure the forces on 2 3 longitudinal, plus the vertical and radial tie rods. The tie rods are loaded in tension and ﬂexion. To measure the tension and ﬂexion strain, 3 strain gauges are placed on the tie rods at 0, 90, and 180. The measured stresses in the tie bars due to the cool-down, causing a shrinkage of the cold mass and putting the tie-bars in tension, are shown in table 2.2. A comparison with the expected values is provided as well. The measured axial and radial shrinkage of the cold mass is shown in ﬁgure 2.10. 2.3.2 Charge and discharge cycles The magnetic tests took place during August 2006, with additional tests during the magnet ﬁeld mapping campaign in October 2006. The current ramps for the ﬁeld mapping are detailed in ﬁg- ure2.11. The tests were carried out through magnet charges to progressively higher currents, setting increasing dI =dt, followed by slow or fast discharges. During these current cycles all the relevant parameters related

Depending on the level of the current at the trigger of a fast discharge, the time needed for re-cooling the coil can be up to 3 days. 2.3.3 Cold mass misalignment The support system is designed to withstand the forces created by a 10 mm magnetic misalign- ment, in any direction of the cold mass with respect to the iron yoke. Geometrical surveys were performed at each step of the magnet assembly to ensure a good positioning. Nevertheless, the monitoring of the coil magnetic misalignment is of prime importance during magnet power test. The misalignment can be calculated either by analysing the displacement of the cold mass or the stresses of the tie rods when the coil is energised. The displacement is measured at several loca- tions and directions at both ends of the coil with respect to the external vacuum tank wall, by the use of rectilinear potentiometers. Results are displayed in ﬁgures 2.12 and2.13. The displacement of the coil’s geometric centre is found to be 0.4 mm in z, in the +z direction. According to the computations, such a displacement indicates that the coil
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||centre should be less than 2 mm off the magnetic centre in +z. As the coil supporting system is hyper-static, the tie rods are not all ini- tially identically loaded. But the force increase during energising is well distributed, as shown in ﬁgure 2.14 and ﬁgure 2.15, giving the force measurements on several tie rods. These ﬁgures also indicate the forces computed in the case of a 10-mm magnetic misalignment, together with forces calculated for the ideally-centred model, showing there is no noticeable effect of misalignment on the forces. Using the strain gauges glued on the cold mass (outer mandrel of the central module, CB0), one can determine the V on Mises stress. The cold mass V on Mises stress versus the coil current is given in ﬁgure 2.16. The measured value of V on Mises stress at 4.5 K and zero current is 23 MPa. The value at 19.1 kA is 138 MPa. These values are in agreement with computations done during design [3, 6]. – 17 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004 Figure 2.12: Axial displacement in Z at both ends of the coil in different positions during energis- ing. Figure 2.13: Radial displacement at both ends of the coil in different positions during energising. 2.3.4 Electrical measurements The apparent coil inductance measured through the inductive voltage V=LdI=dtis decreasing while increasing the current, as the iron yoke reaches the saturation region. From voltage measure- ments at the coil ends in the cryostat, while ramping up the coil current at a regulated dI =dt, the inductance is calculated and results are given in ﬁgure 2.17. Initially the apparent inductance of the coil is 14.7 H at zero current, and then it decreases to 13.3 H at 18 kA. The 21 resistive electrical joints, which connect the 5 modules together and,

The – 18 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004 Figure 2.14: Force increase on several axial tie rods; the average force at zero current is 45 t. Figure 2.15: Force increase on several radial tie rods; the average force at zero current is 15 tons. resistance measurements of the joints indicate values ranging from 0.7 nW to 1.6 nW at 19.1 kA, corresponding to a maximum dissipation in the joint of 0.6 W. The speciﬁc joint cooling system is fully efﬁcient to remove this local heat deposit in order to avoid that the resistive joints generate a local quench of the conductor. As mentioned above, the fast discharge causes a quench of the coil, through the quench-back process. The typical current decay at the nominal current of 19.14 kA is given in ﬁgure 2.18. The effect of the mutual coupling of the coil with the external mandrel is clearly visible at the beginning of the current fast discharge as shown in the zoomed detail of ﬁgure 2.18. It appears clearly that a high dI =dtof about 500 A/s occurs at the very beginning of the discharge.

A maximum temperature difference of 32 K is measured on the coil between the warmest part, located on the coil central module internal radius, and the coldest part, located on the external radius of the mandrel. It

The temperature tends to equilibrate over the whole coil 2 hours after the trigger of the fast discharge. The average cold mass temperature after a fast discharge at 19 kA is 70 K. During a magnet discharge, the dump resistor warms up, with a maximum measured temper- ature increase of 240°C, resulting in an increase of the total dump resistance value by up to 19%. Also the coil internal electrical resistance is increased by up to 0.1 Wat the end of a FD at 19.14 kA. – 20 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004 Figure 2.18: Magnet current during fast discharge at the nominal ﬁeld of 4 T. The insert shows the details at the beginning of the discharge. Figure 2.19: Minimum and maximum temperatures detected on the cold mass during the fast discharge from 19.1 kA. The effect of both the dump resistor and the magnet electrical resistance increasing was revealed through the measurement of the discharge time constant, which was equal to 177 s, 203 s, 263 s, 348 s and 498 s for fast discharges respectively at 19 kA, 17.5 kA, 15 kA, 12.5 kA and 7.5 kA. This is visible in ﬁgure 2.20. The temperature recovery of the dump resistor is achieved in less than 2 hours after the trigger of a fast dump. It is 5 hours after the trigger of a slow dump. In the case of a fast dump at 19.14 kA, typically half of the total energy (1250 MJ) is dissipated as heat in the external dump resistor. The energy dissipated in the dump resistor as a function of the – 21 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004 Figure 2.20: The normalised discharge current as a function of time for different initial currents, showing

The magnet current is precisely measured by the use of two redundant DCCTs (DC current transformer). The peak-to-peak stability of the current is 7 ppm with a voltage ripple of 2.5% (0.65 V). In order to gain on the operation time, an acceleration of the slow dump has been tested and validated by switching to the fast dump conﬁguration at 4 kA. It has been checked that the cryogenic refrigerator can take the full heat load, and the magnet stays in the superconducting state. This Slow Dump Accelerated (SDA) mode was tested in semi-automatic mode through the cryogenics supervisory system and the magnet control system, and it will be fully automatic for the ﬁnal installation in the cavern. – 22 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004 Figure 2.22: Axial forces acting on the yoke Z-stops during the coil energising. 2.3.5 Yoke mechanical measurements The elements of the return yoke, barrels and endcaps, are attached with several hydraulic locking jacks, which are ﬁxed on each barrel and endcap. They are pre-stressed in order to bring the barrels and endcaps into contact at speciﬁc areas using the aluminium-alloy Z-stop blocks. There are 24 Z-stops between each barrel and endcap. A computation of the total axial compressive force gives 8900 tons. The stresses are measured on some Z-stops; the forces on these Z-stops are given in ﬁgure 2.22 and compared to the case of a uniformly distributed load on all the Z-stops. To allow for uniform

During magnet energising, the displacement of the barrel yoke elements under the compressive axial force is very limited, while the displacement of the yoke end cap disk YE+1 is clearly noticeable on the outer radius of the disk, due to the axial attraction of the ﬁrst yoke endcaps towards the interaction point. The measurement of the distance between the barrel elements parallel to the axial axis of the detector is given in ﬁgure 2.23. The endcap YE+1 disk is equipped with rosette strain gauges on its inner face, under the muon chambers and near the bolts at the interface between two adjacent segments. The main stresses measured in these regions do not exceed 88 MPa. 2.3.6 Coil stability characteristics The NbTi superconductor critical temperature is T c= 9.25 K at zero ﬁeld. At B = 4.6 T (peak ﬁeld on the conductor), T c= 7.30 K. The current-sharing temperature T gis deﬁned as the maximum temperature for which the current can ﬂow, with no dissipation, in the superconducting part. For CMS the operating current is 19 143 A, while the critical current, according to the measurements done on a short sample extracted from the length used in the inner layer of the central module (the one exposed to the higher ﬁeld), is I c(T= 4.5 K, B= 4.6 T) = 62 kA leading to T g= 6.44 K, i.e., the temperature margin is 1.94 K. This margin is a little higher than the designed one (1.83 – 23 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004 Figure 2.23: Measured displacement of the yoke during the coil energising.

The T cvalue was conﬁrmed at 9.3 K during cryogenic recovery tests (ﬁgure 2.24) at zero ﬁeld. The conductor pure-aluminium stabilizer RRR, deduced from electrical measurements during cool-down, is found to be above 1800. – 24 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004 Figure 2.25: Measurements of the coil warm-up behaviour as a function of time; the Y-axis scale is common for all the three curves. 2.3.7 Coil warm-up Following the test of the magnet on the surface, the cold mass had to be warmed up to room tem- perature before lowering. The coil, inside its cryostat, was attached to the central barrel YB0 to avoid any risk due to vacuum degradation during the transport operations. The warm-up was per- formed using a dedicated power supply (200 V-300 A DC) to maintain integrity of the coil/mandrel interface. Knowing the temperature dependence of both the electrical resistivity and the speciﬁc heat of the coil materials, the temperature increase for a given electrical power is calculated. Tak- ing into account the capacity of the warm-up supply, and limiting the temperature increase to 1 K/hour, the warm-up was performed as shown in ﬁgure 2.25. As the warm-up was done after a fast discharge, the coil temperature was already at 70 K. Nevertheless, the warm-up took place only at night as the yoke was opened to continue integration activities inside the detector. Ultimately, the warm-up lasted only 3 weeks. The maximum temperature gradient across the coil during the warm-up exercise was less than 9 K.

It surrounds the interaction point and has a length of 5: 8m and a diameter of 2: 5m. The CMS solenoid provides a homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld of 4 T over the full volume of the tracker. At the LHC design luminosity of 1034cm 2s 1there will be on average about 1000 particles from more than 20 overlapping proton-proton interactions traversing the tracker for each bunch crossing, i.e. every 25ns. Therefore a detector technology featuring high granularity and fast response is required, such that the trajectories can be identiﬁed reliably and attributed to the correct bunch crossing. However, these features imply a high power density of the on-detector electronics which in turn requires efﬁcient cooling. This is in direct conﬂict with the aim of keeping to the minimum the amount of material in order to limit multiple scattering, bremsstrahlung, photon conversion and nuclear interactions. A compromise had to be found in this respect. The intense particle ﬂux will also cause severe radiation damage to the tracking system. The main challenge in the design of the tracking system was to develop detector components able to operate in this harsh environment for an expected lifetime of 10 years. These requirements on granularity, speed and radiation hardness lead to a tracker design entirely based on silicon detector technology. The CMS tracker is composed of a pixel detector with three barrel layers at radii between 4: 4cm and 10: 2cm and a silicon strip tracker with 10 barrel detection layers extending outwards to a radius of 1: 1m. Each
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||system is completed by endcaps which consist of 2 disks in the pixel detector and 3 plus 9 disks in the strip tracker on each side of the barrel, extending the acceptance of the tracker up to a pseudorapidity of jhj<2:5. With about 200m2of active silicon area the CMS tracker is the largest silicon tracker ever built [15, 16]. The construction of the CMS tracker, composed of 1440 pixel and 15 148 strip detector modules, required the development of production methods and quality control procedures that are new to the ﬁeld of particle physics detectors. A strong collaboration of 51 institutes with almost 500 physicists and engineers succeeded over a period of 12 to 15 years to design, develop and build this unique device. – 26 – 2008 JINST 3 S080043.1.1 Requirements and operating conditions The expected LHC physics program [17] requires a robust, efﬁcient and precise reconstruction of the trajectories of charged particles with transverse momentum above 1GeV in the pseudorapidity rangejhj<2:5. A precise measurement of secondary vertices and impact parameters is necessary for the efﬁcient identiﬁcation of heavy ﬂavours which are produced in many of the interesting physics channels. Together with the electromagnetic calorimeter and the muon system the tracker has to identify electrons and muons, respectively. Tau leptons are a signature in several discovery channels and need to be reconstructed in one-prong and three-prong decay topologies. In order to reduce the event rate from the LHC bunch crossing rate of 40MHz to about 100Hz which can be permanently stored, tracking information is heavily used in the high level trigger of CMS. The operating conditions for a tracking system at the LHC are very challenging. As already mentioned, each LHC bunch crossing at design luminosity creates on average about 1000 particles hitting the tracker. This leads to a
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||hit rate density of 1MHz= mm2at a radius of 4cm, falling to 60 kHz/mm2at a radius of 22cm and 3 kHz/mm2at a radius of 115cm. In order to keep the occupancy at or below 1% pixelated detectors have to be used at radii below 10cm. For a pixel size of 100150mm2inr-fandz, respectively, which is driven by the desired impact parameter resolution, the occupancy is of the order 10 4per pixel and LHC bunch crossing. At intermediate radii (20cm <r<55cm) the reduced particle ﬂux allows the use of silicon micro-strip detectors with a typical cell size of 10cm 80mm, leading to an occupancy of up to 2–3% per strip and LHC bunch crossing. In the outer region (55cm <r<110cm) the strip pitch can be further increased. Given the large areas that have to be instrumented in this region, also the strip length has to be increased in order to limit the number of read-out channels. However, the strip capacitance scales with its length and therefore the electronics noise is a linear function of the strip length as well. In order to maintain a good signal to noise ratio of well above 10, CMS uses thicker silicon sensors for the outer tracker region (500 mm thickness as opposed to the 320 mm in the inner tracker) with correspondingly higher signal. These thicker sensors would in principle have a higher depletion voltage. But since the radiation levels in the outer tracker are smaller, a higher initial resistivity can be chosen such that the initial depletion voltages of thick and thin sensors are in the same range of 100 V to 300 V . In this way cell sizes up to about 25cm 180mm can be used in the outer region of the tracker, with an occupancy of about 1%. These occupancy-driven design choices for
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||the strip tracker also satisfy the requirements on position resolution. CMS is the ﬁrst experiment using silicon detectors in this outer tracker region. This novel approach was made possible by three key developments: • sensor fabrication on 6 inch instead of 4 inch wafers reduced the sensor cost to 5–10 CHF/cm2and allowed the coverage of the large required surfaces with silicon sensors, • implementation of the front-end read-out chip in industry-standard deep sub-micron technol- ogy led to large cost savings and to an improved signal-to-noise performance, • automation of module assembly and use of high throughput wire bonding machines. The radiation damage introduced by the high particle ﬂuxes at the LHC interaction regions is a severe design constraint. Table 3.1shows the expected fast hadron ﬂuence and radiation dose – 27 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004Table 3.1: Expected hadron ﬂuence and radiation dose in different radial layers of the CMS tracker (barrel part) for an integrated luminosity of 500fb 1(10 years). The fast hadron ﬂuence is a good approximation to the 1MeV neutron equivalent ﬂuence [17].

Neutrons generated by hadronic interactions in the ECAL crystals make up a substantial contribution to the fast hadron ﬂuence, which actually dominates in the outer tracker close to the ECAL surface. The uncertainties on these estimates due to the extrapolation error of the inelastic proton proton cross-section, momentum distributions and multiplicities tops=14TeV and in the Monte Carlo description of the cascade development lead to a safety factor of 1:5 (2 in regions where the neutron
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||contribution dominates) which was applied to these estimates in order to deﬁne the design requirements for the tracker. Three different effects had to be considered in the design of a radiation tolerant silicon tracker. Surface damage is created when the positively charged holes, generated by the passage of an ion- izing particle, get trapped in a silicon oxide layer. This is mostly a concern for the front-end chips where this additional space charge changes for instance the characteristics of MOS structures. Sur- face damage simply scales with the absorbed dose. The silicon sensors are mainly affected by bulk damage, i.e. modiﬁcations to the silicon crystal lattice which are caused by non-ionizing energy loss (NIEL) and lead to additional energy levels in the band gap. NIEL is a complicated process, depending on particle type and energy, but is found to scale approximately with the fast hadron ﬂu- ence. The consequences are an increase of the leakage current (linear in ﬂuence), a change in the doping from n- to p-type with a corresponding change in depletion voltage by a few hundred volts over the lifetime of the tracker, and the creation of additional trapping centers which will reduce the signal by roughly 10% after 10 years of LHC running [18]. The design of the silicon sensors and the read-out electronics has to take this into account and assure a signal-to-noise ratio of 10:1 or better over the full lifetime of the detector, in order to guarantee a robust hit recognition at an acceptable fake hit rate. Finally, transient phenomena due to the generation of charge by ionizing particles in the electronic circuitry can change for instance the state of memory cells and therefore disturb or even stop the correct functioning of the read-out (single event upset, SEU). The increased detector leakage current
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||can lead to a dangerous positive feedback of the self heating of the silicon sensor and the exponential dependence of the leakage current on temperature, called thermal runaway. This has to be avoided by efﬁcient coupling of the silicon sensors to the cooling system and by a low operating temperature. For this reason it is foreseen that the whole tracker volume will be operated at or slightly below  10°C. After 10 years of operation it is – 28 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004expected that this will require a cooling ﬂuid temperature of about  27°C which in turn means that all structures in the tracker have to survive temperature cycles between room temperature and about  30°C. A second effect, called reverse annealing, requires to keep the silicon sensors permanently well below 0°C except for short maintenance periods. This effect is caused by the interaction of radiation induced defects in the silicon sensors which can lead to more serious damage and to an even stronger change in depletion voltage with ﬂuence. Experimentally it is found that reverse annealing becomes insigniﬁcant for temperatures roughly below 0°C [18]. The read-out chips employed in the CMS tracker are fabricated in standard 0: 25mm CMOS technology which is inherently radiation hard due to the thin gate oxide (and special design rules). The lifetime of the silicon strip tracker is therefore limited by the radiation damage to the silicon sensors. For efﬁcient charge collection they always need to be over-depleted, requiring bias volt- ages up to 500 V after 10 years of LHC operation. This reaches the limit of the typical high voltage stability of current sensor layouts. Furthermore, the increased leakage currents of the sensors will at some point lead to thermal runaway. All tests have shown that the silicon strip tracker will re- main fully

For the pixel detector on the other hand, which has to survive even higher radiation doses, under-depleted operation is possible due to a different sensor layout. Its lifetime reaches from at least 2 years at full LHC luminosity for the innermost layer to more than 10 years for the third layer. The ultimate position resolution of the pixel and strip sensors is degraded by multiple scatter- ing in the material that is necessary to precisely hold the sensors, to supply the electrical power (in total about 60 kW for the CMS tracker) and to cool the electronics and the silicon sensors. Nuclear interactions of pions and other hadrons in this material reduce signiﬁcantly the tracking efﬁciency for these particles. In addition, this material leads to photon conversion and bremsstrahlung which adversely affect the measurement accuracy of the electromagnetic calorimeter. It was therefore a requirement to keep the amount of this material to a minimum. 3.1.2 Overview of the tracker layout A schematic drawing of the CMS tracker is shown in ﬁgure 3.1. At radii of 4: 4;7:3 and 10: 2cm, three cylindrical layers of hybrid pixel detector modules surround the interaction point. They are complemented by two disks of pixel modules on each side. The pixel detector delivers three high precision space points on each charged particle trajectory. It is described in detail in section 3.2. In total the pixel detector covers an area of about 1m2and has 66 million pixels. The radial region between 20cm and 116cm is occupied by the silicon strip tracker, which is described in detail in section 3.3. It is composed of three different subsystems. The Tracker Inner Barrel and Disks (TIB/TID) extend in radius towards 55cm and are composed of 4 barrel layers, supplemented by 3 disks
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||at each end. TIB/TID delivers up to 4 r-fmeasurements on a trajectory using 320 mm thick silicon micro-strip sensors with their strips parallel to the beam axis in the barrel and radial on the disks. The strip pitch is 80 mm on layers 1 and 2 and 120 mm on layers 3 and 4 in the TIB, leading to a single point resolution of 23 mm and 35 mm, respectively. In the TID the mean pitch varies between 100 mm and 141 mm. The TIB/TID is surrounded by the Tracker Outer Barrel (TOB). It has an outer radius of 116cm and consists of 6 barrel layers of 500mm thick micro-strip sensors with strip pitches of 183 mm on the ﬁrst 4 layers and 122 mm on – 29 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004 TEC+ TEC-TOB TOBTIB TIBTID TID TIDTID PIXEL -2600 -2200 -1800 -1400 -1000 -600 -200 200 600 1000 1400 1800 2200 2600-1200-1000-800-600-400-200020040060080010001200 z (mm)r (mm)0.1 0.3 0.5 0.7 0.9 1.1 1.3 1.5 1.7 1.9 2.1 2.3 2.5 -2.5-2.3-2.1-1.9-1.7-1.5 -1.3 -1.1 -0.9 -0.7 -0.5 -0.3 -0.1 0.1ηFigure 3.1: Schematic cross section through the CMS tracker.

It provides another 6 r-fmeasurements with single point resolution of 53 mm and 35mm, respectively. The TOB extends in zbetween118cm. Beyond this zrange the Tracker EndCaps (TEC+ and TEC- where the sign indicates the location along the zaxis) cover the region 124cm <jzj<282cm and 22: 5cm<jrj<113:5cm. Each TEC is composed of 9 disks, carrying up to 7 rings of silicon micro-strip detectors (320 mm thick on the inner 4 rings, 500 mm thick on rings 5-7) with radial strips of 97 mm to 184 mm average pitch. Thus, they provide up to 9 f measurements
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||per trajectory. In addition, the modules in the ﬁrst two layers and rings, respectively, of TIB, TID, and TOB as well as rings 1, 2, and 5 of the TECs carry a second micro-strip detector module which is mounted back-to-back with a stereo angle of 100 mrad in order to provide a measurement of the second co-ordinate (z in the barrel and ron the disks). The achieved single point resolution of this measurement is 230 mm and 530 mm in TIB and TOB, respectively, and varies with pitch in TID and TEC. This tracker layout ensures at least 9 hits in the silicon strip tracker in the full range of jhj<2:4 with at least4 of them being two-dimensional measurements (ﬁgure 3.2). The ultimate acceptance of the tracker ends at jhj2:5. The CMS silicon strip tracker has a total of 9.3 million strips and 198 m2of active silicon area. Figure 3.3shows the material budget of the CMS tracker in units of radiation length. It increases from 0.4 X0ath0 to about 1.8 X0atjhj1:4, beyond which it falls to about 1 X0at jhj2:5. 3.1.3 Expected performance of the CMS tracker For single muons of transverse momenta of 1, 10 and 100 GeV ﬁgure 3.4shows the expected reso- lution of transverse momentum, transverse impact parameter and longitudinal impact parameter, as a function of pseudorapidity [17].

The transverse impact parameter resolution reaches 10 mm for high pTtracks, domi- nated by the resolution of the ﬁrst pixel hit, while at lower momentum it is degraded by multiple scattering (similarly for the longitudinal impact parameter). Figure 3.5shows the expected track reconstruction efﬁciency of the CMS tracker for single muons and pions as a function of pseudo- rapidity. For muons, the efﬁciency is about 99% over most of the acceptance. For jhj0 the efﬁ- ciency decreases slightly due to gaps between the ladders of the pixel detector at z0. At high h the efﬁciency drop is mainly due to the reduced coverage by the pixel forward disks. For pions and hadrons in general the efﬁciency is lower because of interactions with the material in the tracker. – 31 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004 h0 0.5 1 1.5 2 h0 0.5 1 1.5 2) [%]t/pt pd(s 110, pt=1GeVm , pt=10GeVm , pt=100GeVm h0 0.5 1 1.5 2 h0 0.5 1 1.5 2m]m) [0 dd(s 10210, pt=1GeVm , pt=10GeVm , pt=100GeVm h0 0.5 1 1.5 2 h0

The tracker support tube is a large cylinder 5.30 m long with an inner diameter of 2.38 m. The 30-mm-thick wall of the cylinder is made by two 950-1/T300 carbon ﬁber composite skins, 2 mm in thickness, sandwiching a 26-mm-high Nomex core. Over the entire length of the tube’s inner surface, two carbon ﬁber rails are attached on the horizontal plane. The tracker outer barrel (TOB) and both endcaps (TEC+ and TEC-) rest on these rails by means of adjustable sliding pads. The tracker inner barrel and disks (TIB/TID) are in turn supported by the TOB. The angle between the guiding elements of these rails is controlled to better than 0.183 mrad, corresponding to a parallelism between the guides better than 0:5mm in all directions over the full length. An independent support and insertion system for the pixel detectors, the central section of the beam pipe and the inner elements of the radiation monitor system spans the full length of the tracker at its inner radius. This is composed of
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||three long carbon ﬁber structures, joined together during tracker assembly to form two continuous parallel planes, on which precision tracks for the installation, support and positioning of each element are machined. The central element is a 2266.5-mm-long and 436-mm-wide cylinder which is connected with ﬂanges to the TIB/TID detector. This element provides support and accurate positioning to the pixel detectors. Two 2420- – 32 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004mm-long side elements are coupled to it only by very precise pinned connections, bridging the gap between the faces of the TIB/TID and the closing ﬂanges of the tracker without direct contact to the TEC detectors. These side elements are therefore structurally decoupled from the silicon strip detectors and can be installed and removed at any time with no impact on the strip detectors. They serve several purposes: they provide support and alignment features for the central section of the beam pipe, they allow the installation of the inner elements of the radiation monitor system, and they are used for installation and removal of all the components permanently or temporarily housed in the inner region of the tracker: beam pipe, bake-out equipment, pixel barrel, pixel disks and radiation monitor. This system of permanent tracks, light but very stiff and stable, installed in the core of the tracker will allow for the quickest possible intervention in this region during maintenance, inducing no disturbance to the volume occupied by the silicon strip detectors. This feature will be extremely valuable after some years of operation, when activation of components and radiation damage on sensors will start becoming an issue. The outer surface of the tracker tube faces the electromagnetic calorimeter, which is operated at room temperature and requires good temperature stability. The surface of the electromagnetic calorimeter must be kept at (184)°C while the tracker
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||volume needs to be cooled to below  10°C. In order to achieve this thermal gradient over a very limited radial thickness, the inside surface of the tracker support tube is lined with an active thermal screen. It ensures a temperature below 10°C inside the tracker volume even when the sub-detectors and their cooling are switched off, while maintaining a temperature above +12°C on the outer surface of the support tube in order to avoid condensation. It also reduces the thermal stress across the support tube structure. The thermal screen consists of 32 panels. On the inside, cold ﬂuid is circulated in a thin aluminium plate whilst, separated by 8mm of Rohacell foam, several polyimide-insulated resistive circuits are powered to heat up the outer surface to the required temperature. The system is feed-back controlled, based on 64 temperature sensors. The total power dissipation inside the tracker volume is expected to be close to 60 kW. Mainly for robustness in operation, the CMS tracker is equipped with a mono-phase liquid cooling system. The liquid used for refrigeration of the silicon strip and pixel detector as well as the thermal screen is C 6F14. It has a sufﬁciently low viscosity even at the lowest required temperature, excellent behaviour under irradiation and is extremely volatile (with practically no residues) thus minimizing eventual damages from accidental leaks. The cooling system provides up to 77m3=hour of C 6F14 liquid to the tracker, at a temperature of down to  35°C and with a pressure drop of up to 8 bar. This corresponds to a cooling capacity of up to 128 kW. The full tracker volume (about 25m3) is ﬂushed with pre-chilled dry nitrogen gas at a rate of up to one volume exchange per hour. 3.2 Pixel detector 3.2.1 Pixel system general The pixel system is the part
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||of the tracking system that is closest to the interaction region. It contributes precise tracking points in r-fandzand therefore is responsible for a small impact parameter resolution that is important for good secondary vertex reconstruction. With a pixel cell – 33 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004 Efficiency ( z 2Hits ) Pseudorapidity hRadiusFigure 3.6: Geometrical layout of the pixel detector and hit coverage as a function of pseudorapidity. size of 100150mm2emphasis has been put on achieving similar track resolution in both r-fand zdirections. Through this a 3D vertex reconstruction in space is possible, which will be important for secondary vertices with low track multiplicity. The pixel system has a zero-suppressed read out scheme with analog pulse height read-out. This improves the position resolution due to charge sharing and helps to separate signal and noise hits as well as to identify large hit clusters from overlapping tracks. The pixel detector covers a pseudorapidity range  2.5< h<2.5, matching the acceptance of the central tracker. The pixel detector is essential for the reconstruction of secondary vertices from b and tau decays, and forming seed tracks for the outer track reconstruction and high level triggering. It consists of three barrel layers (BPix) with two endcap disks (FPix). The 53-cm-long BPix layers will be located at mean radii of 4.4, 7.3 and 10.2 cm. The FPix disks extending from 6 to 15 cm in radius, will be placed on each side at z=34.5 and z=46.5 cm. BPix (FPix) contain 48 million (18 million) pixels covering a total area of 0.78 (0.28) m2. The arrangement of the 3 barrel layers and the forward pixel disks on each side gives 3 tracking points over almost the full h-range. Figure 3.6shows the geometric arrangement and the hit coverage as a function of pseudorapidity h. In the high hregion
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||the 2 disk points are combined with the lowest possible radius point from the 4.4 cm barrel layer. The vicinity to the interaction region also implies a very high track rate and particle ﬂuences that require a radiation tolerant design. For the sensor this led to an n+ pixel on n-substrate detector design that allows partial depleted operation even at very high particle ﬂuences. For the barrel layers the drift of the electrons to the collecting pixel implant is perpendicular to the 4 T magnetic ﬁeld of CMS. The resulting Lorentz drift leads to charge spreading of the collected signal charge over more than one pixel. With the analog pulse height being read out a charge interpolation allows – 34 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004to achieve a spatial resolution in the range of 15–20 mm. The forward detectors are tilted at 20in a turbine-like geometry to induce charge-sharing. The charge-sharing is mainly due to the geometric effect of particles entering the detector at an average angle of 20away from normal incidence [19]; charge-sharing is also enhanced by the ~E~Bdrift. A position resolution of approximately 15 mm in both directions can be achieved with charge-sharing between neighbouring pixels. The reduction in the depletion depth or the increase in bias voltage will lead to a reduction of charge-sharing and therefore a degradation of the spatial resolution with radiation damage. In order to allow a replacement of the innermost layers the mechanics and the cabling of the pixel system has been designed to allow a yearly access if needed. At full LHC luminosity we expect the innermost layer to stay operational for at least 2 years. The 3 layer barrel mechanics as well as the forward disks are divided into a left and a right half. This is required to allow installation along
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||the beam pipe and to pass beyond the beam pipe support wires at z= 1632 mm. The 6 individual mechanical pieces are referenced to each other through precisely machined rails inside the TIB cylinder. Power, cooling, the optical controls as well as the optical read-out lines are brought to the detector through supply tube shells. In case of the barrel pixel system the supply tubes have a ﬂexible connection that needs to bend by a few degrees during insertion following the slightly curved rails around the beam pipe support ring. The pixel system is inserted as the last sub-detector of CMS after the silicon strip tracker has been installed and after the central section of the beam pipe has been installed and baked out. 3.2.2 Sensor description Technological choices The sensors for the CMS-pixel detector adopt the so called n-on-n concept. The pixels consist of high dose n-implants introduced into a high resistance n-substrate. The rectifying pn-junction is placed on the back side of the sensor surrounded by a multi guard ring structure. Despite the higher costs due to the double sided processing this concept was chosen as the collection of elec- trons ensures a high signal charge at moderate bias voltages (< 600V) after high hadron ﬂuences. Furthermore the double sided processing allows a guard ring scheme keeping all sensor edges at ground potential. The isolation technique applied for the regions between the pixel electrodes was developed in close collaboration with the sensor vendors. Open p-stops [20] were chosen for the disks and moderated p-spray [21] for the barrel. Both types of sensors showed sufﬁcient radiation hardness during an extensive qualiﬁcation procedure including several test beams [22, 23]. Disk sensors The disk sensors use the p-stop technique for interpixel isolation. To maximize the charge collec- tion efﬁciency and minimize

Figure 3.7 shows a photograph of 4 pixel cells. The open ring p-stops, the bump-bonding pad and the contact between the aluminium and the implanted collecting electrode are highlighted. – 35 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004 Figure 3.7: Picture of four pixels in the same double column for a pixel disk sensor. Aluminium p-ImplantBias dot Bias grid Contact viaBump (In)Full p-spray doseReduced p-spray Figure 3.8: Photograph of four pixel cells. The Indium bumps are already deposited but not yet reﬂown. The opening on the p-stop rings provides a low resistance path until full depletion is reached to allow IV (current-voltage) characterization of the sensor on wafer and a high resistance path when the sensor is over-depleted (10–20 V over-depletion) to assure interpixel isolation. The process is completely symmetric with ﬁve photolithographic steps on each side to mini- mize the mechanical stress on the silicon substrate and the potential bowing of the diced sensors. The sensors were all fabricated in 2005 on 4 inch wafers. The depletion voltage is 45–50 V and the leakage current is less than 10 nA per cm2. The 7 different sensor tiles needed to populate a disk blade, ranging from 1 2 read-out chips (ROCs) to 2 5 ROCs, are implemented on a single wafer. A production yield higher than 90% has been achieved and 150 good sensors for each of the seven ﬂavours are available to the project for module assembly. Barrel sensors The sensors for the pixel barrel use the moderated p-spray technique for interpixel isolation. A photograph of four pixels in a barrel sensor is shown in ﬁgure 3.8. Most area of a pixel
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||is covered with the collecting electrode formed by the n-implant. The gap between the n-implants is kept small (20 mm) to provide a homogeneous drift ﬁeld which leads to a relatively high capacitance of the order of 80-100 fF per pixel. – 36 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004In one corner of each pixel the so called bias dot is visible. They provide a high resistance punch-through connection to all pixels which allows on-wafer IV measurements which are impor- tant to exclude faulty sensors from the module production. The dark frame around the pixel implants visible in ﬁgure 3.8indicates the opening in the nitride covering the thermal oxide. In this region the p-spray dose reaches the full level. Close to the lateral pn-junction between the pixel implant and the p-sprayed inter-pixel region the boron dose is reduced. The sensor shown in ﬁgure 3.8has undergone the bump deposition process. The Indium bumps are visible as roughly 50 mm wide octagons. The sensors are processed on n-doped DOFZ-silicon [24] with h111i orientation and a resis- tivity of about 3: 7kWcm (after processing). This leads to a full depletion voltage of 50-60 V of the 285 mm thick sensors. All wafers for the production of the barrel sensors come from the same silicon ingot to provide the best possible homogeneity of all material parameters. The pixel barrel requires two different sensor geometries, 708 full (2 8 ROCs) and 96 half modules (18 ROCs). They were processed in 2005 and 2006 using two different mask sets. 3.2.3 Pixel detector read-out System overview The pixel read-out and control system [25] consists of three parts: a read-out data link from the modules/blades to the pixel front end driver (pxFED), a fast control link from the pixel front end controller (pFEC) to the modules/blades and a slow control
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||link from a standard FEC to the supply tube/service cylinder. The latter is used to conﬁgure the ASICs on the supply tube/service cylinder through a I2C protocol. Figure 3.9shows a sketch of the system. The front end consists of a Token Bit Manager (TBM) chip which controls several read-out chips (ROCs). The pFEC sends the 40MHz clock and fast control signals (e.g. trigger, reset) to the front end and programs all front end devices. The pxFED receives data from the front end, digitizes it, formats it and sends it to the CMS-DAQ event builder. The pFEC, FEC and pxFED are VME modules located in the electronics room and are connected to the front end through 40 MHz optical links. The various components are described in the following sections. Read-out chip Sensor signals are read out by ROCs bump bonded to the sensors. A ROC is a full custom ASIC fabricated in a commercial 0.25- mm 5-metal-layer CMOS process and contains 52 80 pixels [26]. Its main purposes are: • Ampliﬁcation and buffering of the charge signal from the sensor. • Zero suppression in the pixel unit cell. Only signals above a certain threshold will be read out. This threshold can be adjusted individually for each pixel by means of four trim bits. The trim bits have a capacitive protection against single event upset (SEU), which has shown to reduce SEUs by 2 orders of magnitude [26]. The mean threshold dispersion after trimming at T= 10°C is 90 electrons equivalent with a noise of 170 electrons. – 37 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004 PLLCCU LVDSmux mDOH AOH pxFECBARREL ENDFLANGE / ADAPTER CARD SUPPLY TUBE / SERVICE CYLINDER COUNTING ROOMALT I2C L1A(trig, cal, sync, reset) CLK CLKI2C Analog OutHard ResetCLKL1AAnalog out DOH DATACLKSlow I2CDelayLCDS drivers LCDS drivers Gate-Keeperelectrical optical DATASlow I2CMODULE / PANEL

Hit information without a corresponding L1 trigger is aban- doned. • Sending hit information and some limited conﬁguration data (analog value of last addressed DAC) to the TBM chip. Pixel addresses are transferred as 6 level analog encoded digital values within 5 clock cycles (125ns) while the pulse height information is truly analog. • Adjusting various voltage levels, currents and offsets in order to compensate for chip-to-chip variations in the CMOS device parameters. There are a total of 29 DACs on the chip. The ROC needs two supply voltages of 1.5 V and 2.5 V . There are 6 on chip voltage regulators. They compensate for differences in supply voltage due to voltage drops in module cables of dif- ferent lengths, improve AC power noise rejection and strongly reduce intermodule cross-talk. An on-chip temperature sensor allows the monitoring of the module temperature online. The ROC is controlled through a modiﬁed I2C interface running at 40 MHz. The conﬁguration data can be downloaded without stopping data acquisition. There are a few architecture inherent data loss mechanisms. The particle detection inefﬁ- ciency has been measured in a high-rate pion beam. It is in fairly good agreement with expectations and reaches 0.8%, 1.2% and 3.8% respectively for the three layers at a luminosity of 1034s 1cm 2 and 100 kHz L1 trigger rate. The power consumption depends on the pixel hit rate. At the LHC design luminosity, the ROC contributes with 34 mW per pixel about 88% (62%) to the total pixel detector front end power budget before (after) the detector has received a total ﬂuence of 6 1014/cm2. – 38 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004Token Bit Manager chip The TBM [27] controls the
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||read-out of a group of pixel ROCs. The TBM is designed to be located on the detector near to the pixel ROCs. In the case of the barrel, they will be mounted on the detector modules and will control the read-out of 8 or 16 ROCs depending upon the layer radius. In the case of the forward disks, they will be mounted on the disk blades and will control the read- out of 21 or 24 ROCs depending on blade side. A TBM and the group of ROCs that it controls will be connected to a single analog optical link over which the data will be sent to the front end driver, a ﬂash ADC module located in the electronics house. The principal functions of the TBM include the following: • It will control the read-out of the ROCs by initiating a token pass for each incoming Level-1 trigger. • On each token pass, it will write a header and a trailer word to the data stream. • The header will contain an 8 bit event number and the trailer will contain 8 bits of error status. These will be transferred as 2 bit analog encoded digital. • It will distribute the Level-1 triggers, and clock to the ROCs. Each arriving Level-1 trigger will be placed on a 32-deep stack awaiting its associated token pass. Normally the stack will be empty but is needed to accommodate high burst rates due to noise, high track density events, or trigger bursts. Since there will be two analog data links per module for the inner two layers of the barrel, the TBMs will be conﬁgured as pairs in a Dual TBM Chip. In addition to two TBMs, this chip also contains a Control Network. The Hub serves as a port addressing switch for
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||control commands that are sent from the DAQ to the front end TBMs and ROCs. These control commands will be sent over a digital optical link from a front end controller in the electronics house to the front end Hubs. The commands will be sent using a serial protocol, running at a speed of 40 MHz. This high speed is mandated by the need to rapidly cycle through a refreshing of the pixel threshold trim bits that can become corrupted due to single event upsets. There are four external, write only ports on each Hub for communicating with the ROCs and there is one internal read/write port for communicating with the TBMs within the chip. The ﬁrst byte of each command will contain a 5-bit Hub address and a 3-bit port address. When a Hub is addressed, it selects the addressed port, strips off the byte containing the Hub/port address and passes the remainder of the command stream unmodiﬁed onto the addressed port. The outputs of the external ports consist of two low voltage differential lines for sending clock and data. Analog chain The hit information is read out serially through analog links in data packets containing all hits belonging to a single trigger. Within such packets a new analog value is transmitted every 25 ns and digitized in the Front End Driver (pxFED) at the same rate. Each pixel hit uses 6 values, or 150 ns. Five values are used to encode the address of a pixel inside a ROC and the sixth value represents the signal charge. Only the charge signals are truly analog while headers and addresses are discrete levels generated by DACs. No ROC IDs are sent but every ROC adds a header, whether – 39 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004it has hits or not in
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||order to make the association of hits to ROCs possible. The sequential read-out is controlled by a token bit which is emitted by the TBM, passed from ROC to ROC and back to the TBM. The differential electrical outputs of the ROCs are multiplexed by the TBM onto either one or two output lines. On the same lines the TBM transmits a header before starting the ROC read-out. After receiving the token back from the last ROC in the chain the TBM sends a trailer containing status information. From the TBM to the end ring of the pixel barrel the read-out uses the module Kapton cable. The Kapton cable has a ground mesh on the back side and the differential analog lines are separated by quiet lines from the fast digital signals. Nevertheless, cross-talk from LVDS signals was found to be unacceptable and a low swing digital protocol is being used instead. On the end ring the analog signals are separated from the digital and all analog signals of the sector are sent on a separate Kapton cable to a printed circuit board that houses the Analog Optical Hybrids (AOH). The signal path between TBM and AOH is designed with a constant impedance of 40 W and terminated on the AOH. The optical links of the pixel system are identical to those used in the silicon strip tracker. An ASIC that adapts the output levels of the pixel modules to those expected by the laser driver has been added to the AOH of the pixel system. A clean identiﬁcation of the six levels used for encoding pixel addresses is crucial for the reconstruction of hits. The ratio of RMS width to separation of the digitized levels after the full read-out chain is 1:30. The rise-time at the digitizer input is
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||3 ns which makes corrections from previously transmitted levels negligible. The full read-out chain adds a noise equivalent to 300 electrons to the analog pulse height, dominated by baseline variations of the laser drivers. Front End Driver Optical signals from the pixel front end electronics (ROCs and TBMs) are digitized using the pixel Front End Digitizer (pxFED). A pxFED is a 9U VME module. It has 36 optical inputs each equipped with an optical receiver and an ADC. The ADC converts at LHC frequency supplied by the TTC system which can be adjusted by an individually programmed phase shift (16 steps within 25 ns) for precise timing. A programmable offset voltage to compensate bias shifts can also be set. The output of the 10 bit-ADC is processed by a state machine to deliver pixel event fragments consisting of header, trailer, input channel number, ROC numbers, double column numbers and addresses and amplitudes of hit pixels all at a subject-dependent resolution of 5 to 8 bits. Event fragments are strobed into FIFO-1 (1k deep 36 bit wide) which can be held on demand to enable read-out via VME. In normal processing mode FIFO-1 is open and data of 4 (5) combined input channels are transmitted to 8 FIFO-2 memories (8k 72 bits). In order to determine thresholds and levels required for the state machine, FIFO-1 can alternatively be operated in a transparent mode making unprocessed ADC output data available. The output from FIFO-2 is clocked into two FIFO-3 memories (8k 72 bits) whose outputs are combined to provide the data now at a frequency of 80 MHz (twice the common operating pxFED-frequency) to the S-Link interface acting as a point-to-point link with the CMS-DAQ system. Parallel to the data ﬂow spy FIFOs are implemented (restricted in size) to hold selected event
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||fragments and make them available for checking data integrity. Error detection takes place in the data stream from FIFO-1 to FIFO-2 and corresponding ﬂags are embedded in the event trailer and also accessible from VME. A selected DAC output from each ROC (on default representing the ROC’s temperature) is available as well. – 40 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004In addition, errors are directly transmitted to the CMS-TTS system using a dedicated connector on the S-Link supplementary card. A histogramming feature has been implemented to monitor the rate of double column hits. This histogram is intended to be read out via VME periodically to check for dead or overloaded columns. The pxFED houses an internal test system which, when enabled, replaces the normal ADC input by a pattern of 256 clocked analog levels simulating a normal pixel event. There are three test DACs (10-bit) available to generate such a pattern meaning that every third input channel receives the same simulated event. This test system allows to test most of the features of the pxFED without the need of external optical input signals. All FIFOs, the state machine with its adjustable parameters, the VME protocol, error detection and histogramming features are integrated into several FPGAs mounted on daughter cards making the pxFED ﬂexible to changes and improvements. The corresponding ﬁrmware can be downloaded via VME or using a JTAG bus connector mounted on the mother board. The whole pixel read-out system will consist of 40 pxFED modules (32 for the barrel and 8 for the forward) set up in three 9U VME crates located in the electronics room. Individual modules can be accessed by VME geographical addressing. Front End Controller The Pixel Front End Controller (pFEC) supplies clock and trigger information to the front end, and provides a data path to the
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||front end for conﬁguration settings over a ﬁber optic connection. The pFEC uses the same hardware as the standard CMS FEC-CCS [28]. The ﬁrmware which deﬁnes the behaviour of the mezzanine FEC (mFEC) module has been replaced by a pixel speciﬁc version, converting the FEC into a pFEC. Each mFEC board becomes two command links to the front end. The Trigger Encoder performs all trigger transmission functions, encoding TTC triggers to match the pixel standard, block triggers to a given channel, generate internal triggers, either singly, or continuously, for testing purposes. Within each command link are a one kilobyte output buffer for data transmission, and a two kilobyte input buffer for data receiving. All data, whether write or read operations, are retransmitted back from the front end for possible veriﬁcation. To minimize the VME data transfer time, the pFEC uses several data transfer modes. When transferring pixel trim values to the front end, the pFEC calculates the row number information for a given column of pixels on the ﬂy. This results in nearly a 50% reduction in the time required to transfer trim values over VME to a given command link buffer. In this way, the entire pixel front end trims can be reloaded in 12 s. Another 2 s are used to load the other conﬁguration registers, for a total of 14 s to reload the front end completely. This column mode is also the reason that the return buffer is twice as big as the transmit buffer. The return buffer receives the row number as well as the trim value for each pixel. Once data is loaded into an output buffer, the transfer may be initiated either by computer control, or by a signal from the TTC system. Since single event upsets are expected to occur in the
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||front end registers, it is anticipated that periodic updates will be necessary. Since updating the front end may disrupt data taking, it is preferable to perform small updates synchronized to orbit gaps or private orbits. This is done through the TTC initiated downloads. For transmission veriﬁcation purposes, the number of bytes transmitted is compared to the number of bytes returned from the front end. Also, the returning Hub/port address is compared to the transmitted address. Status bits are set with the results of this comparison, and these values are stored, for possible review, should an error condition occur. – 41 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004 LVDS MUXCCUDataIn+ClockDataOut+Clock Primary RingCCU no de 1I C2 ResetsDataIn+ClockDataOut+Clock Secondary Ring LVDS MUXCCUCCU no de 2I C2 ResetsLVDS MUXCCUCCU node 4/8I C2 ResetsLVDS MUXCCUDummy CCU nodeAuxLVDS MUXCCUCCU node 3/7I C2 ResetsI C2I C2LVDS BufferCCU Board Digi tal OptohybridsResetFigure 3.10: Block diagram of the Pixel front end control system. Note that the total number of CCU nodes is 9 for the BPix and 5 for the FPix. The detector front end control system The CMS Pixel detector front end control system for both the barrel (BPix) and the forward (FPix) detectors consists of four communication and control unit boards (CCU Boards). Each CCU board controls a quarter of the detector with eight Barrel read-out sectors or twelve Forward port cards. Figure 3.10 shows the block diagram of a CCU Board. The same ring topology conﬁgured as a local area network as in the silicon strip tracker is used. The front end controller (FEC) module is the master of the network and uses two optical ﬁbers to send the timing and data signals to a number of slave CCU nodes, and another two ﬁbers to receive return communication trafﬁc. The two receiver channels on the digital optohybrid
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||(DOH) transmit the 40 MHz clock and control data at 40 Mbit/s in the direction from the FEC to the ring of communication and control units (CCUs). The two transmitter channels send clock and data back to the FEC from the ring of CCUs. The CCU is the core component developed for the slow control, monitoring and timing distribution in the tracking system [29]. To improve system reliability against a single component failure a redundant interconnection scheme based on doubling signal paths and bypassing of faulty CCUs is implemented. An additional “dummy” CCU node allows to mitigate a single DOH failure preserving complete functionality. A CCU node failure leads to a loss of communication to all electronics attached to that CCU. The ﬁrst two CCU nodes in the ring provide also the I2C data channels necessary to control the digital optohybrids on the CCU boards. In the BPix each read-out sector is controlled by a separate CCU node. Eight active and one dummy CCU node build a single control ring. One I2C data channel is used to access and control the front end read-out electronics and three output channels generate the necessary signals to reset the digital and the analog optohybrids as well as the read-out chips (ROCs) in one read-out sector. The FPix control ring consists of four active and one dummy CCU node. Each of the active CCU nodes control 3 port cards, which constitute a 45sector in the detector coverage at one end. A connection between a CCU and a port card includes a bi-directional 100 KHz I2C communication channel and two reset signals. One reset signal is for the port card electronics, and the other one goes to the read-out chips on the detector panels. – 42 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004 Figure 3.11: Complete support

The barrel with its length of 570 mm is much shorter than the Silicon Strip Tracker inside which it is installed. Supply tubes carry services along the beam pipe from patch panels located outside of the tracker volume to the barrel. The supply tubes also house electronics for read-out and control. The length of the full system is 5.60 m. Support structure and supply tubes are split vertically to allow in- stallation in the presence of the beam-pipe and its supports. Electrically the +zand zsides of the barrel are separated. Each side is divided in 16 sectors which operate almost independently, sharing only the slow control system. Pixel barrel support structure The detector support structure for the three layers at the radii of four, seven and eleven centimeters equipped with silicon pixel modules has a length of 570 mm ranging from  285 mm to +285 mm closest to the CMS interaction region. Figure 3.11 shows a sketch of a complete support structure half shell. Aluminium cooling tubes with a wall thickness of 0.3 mm are the backbones of the support structure. Carbon ﬁber blades with a thickness of 0.24 mm are glued onto the top or bottom of two adjacent cooling tubes in such a way that their normal directions alternate pointing either to the beam or away from it. The tubes have trapezoidal cross sections deﬁned by the azimuthal angles of the ladders they hold. Four to ﬁve of these tubes are laser welded to an aluminium container which distributes the cooling ﬂuid. The resulting manifold provides the

Pixel detector supply tube. The electrical power lines, the electrical control signal and the opti- cal signals as well as the cooling ﬂuid are transferred across the supply tubes to the pixel barrel. The two supply tube parts of a half shell in +zand zdirection have a length of 2204 mm (ﬁgure 3.12). The supporting elements of the basic structure are the stainless steel tubes with a wall thick- ness of 0.1 mm running along the z-direction connected to the stiffener rings (FR4) and the inner and outer ﬂanges made out of aluminium. The tubes supply the detector with the cooling ﬂuid. The gaps in between are ﬁlled with foamed material with the corresponding shape to guarantee the necessary rigidity. All power and slow control leads are embedded in the supply tube body. This allows a clear layout of the wiring and also makes the system more reliable. The motherboards, which hold the optical hybrids for the analog and digital control links, are installed in the eight read-out slots near the detector on the integrated supply boards. The cor- responding boards at the outer ends carry the power adapter boards, which provide the detector power and the bias voltage for this sector. In the central slot the digital

These adapters are mounted at the circumference in the ﬁrst part of the supply tube. The length of each supply tube is 2204 mm. Only a ﬂexible mechanical connection is made between the barrel and the supply tube. Pixel barrel detector modules The barrel part of the CMS pixel detector consists of about 800 detector modules. While the majority of the modules (672) are full modules as seen in ﬁgure 3.13 on the right, the edges of the six half-shells are equipped with 16 half-modules each (96 in total, see ﬁgure 3.13 on the left). Geometry and components. A module is composed of the following components (ﬁgure 3.13). One or two basestrips made from 250 mm thick silicon nitride provide the support of the module.

The plot does not contain contributions from the pixel support cylinder, the supply tube and cabling from the detector end ﬂange to the supply tube. A completed full-module has the dimensions 66: 626:0 mm2, weights 2.2 g plus up to 1.3 g for cables, and consumes 2 W of power. The material of the pixel barrel amounts to 5 percent of a radiation length in the central region. Sensors and read-out chips contribute one third of the material while support structure and cooling ﬂuid contribute about 50 percent. The distribution of material as a function of pseudorapidity is shown in ﬁgure 3.14. 3.2.5 The forward pixel detector The FPix detector consists of two completely separate sections, one on each side of the interac- tion region. They are located inside the BPix supply tube but are mounted on separate insertion rails. Each section is split vertically down the middle so the detector can be installed around the beam-pipe and its vertical support wire and so it can also be removed for servicing during ma- jor maintenance periods without disturbing the beam-pipe. Each of these four sections is called a half-cylinder. Mechanics of a half-cylinder Each half-cylinder consists

The half-disks support the actual pixel detectors that extend from 6 cm to 15 cm in radius from the beam. The half-disk has 12 cooling channels (each in the shape of a “U”) assembled between a half ring shown in ﬁgure 3.15. The assembly requires three slightly different types of cooling channels. Each channel is made by Al-brazing two blocks of Al with the channel for the cooling ﬂuid already – 46 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004 Figure 3.15: The FPix half-disk cooling channels mounted in the outer half-ring structure. The turbine-like geometry is apparent. Panels are mounted on both sides of the cooling channels. machined in the two parts. The brazed parts are then machined to their ﬁnal shape. The walls of the channels are 0.5 mm thick. The average weight of the channels is 8.21 g. All channels passed a Helium leak test at 1.33 10 8mbar-litre/s. The pressure drop of the individual cooling channels for a ﬂow of 2600 sccm of dry N 2is 0.490.02 mbar. Six daisy- chained cooling channels form a cooling loop. The pressure drop over a loop (for a ﬂow rate of 1230 sccm) of dry N 2is 0:960:13 mbar. For C 6F14at 20°C with a rate of 12cc-s the pressure drop is 294 mbar. Each of the twelve cooling channels of a half-disk has trapezoidal beryllium panels attached to each side. The panels support the sensors and read-out chips that constitute the actual particle detectors. As explained above, the cooling channels are rotated to form a turbine-like geometry to enhance charge-sharing. The panels are made of 0.5mm beryllium. The beryllium provides a strong, stable and relatively low-mass support
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||for the actual pixel detectors. The cooling channels are supplied with C 6F14at about 15°C. A single cooling channel with panels mounted on both sides forms a subassembly called a blade. There are 24 panels, forming 12 blades, in each half-disk. Powering up the electronics on one blade increases the temperature by 2°C. The tempera- ture of each ROC is part of the information available for each event. Each panel also has a resistance temperature detection sensor. The pixel sensors have ﬁducial marks visible with a coordinate mea- suring machine (CMM). Their position is then related to reference marks mounted on the half-disk units. After installing the half-disks in the half-cylinder, the disk position is measured relative to the half-cylinder using a CMM and also by photogrammetry. This permits relating the position of the sensors to the CMS detector.

The deformation (magnitude and direction) of the panels on a half-disk, when its temperature changes from 20°C to  20°C has been measured to be 150 mm. This result has been reproduced by a ﬁnite element analysis of the half-disk and it will be used in the ﬁnal alignment of the pixels. We anticipate knowing the pixel geometry to a few
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||tens of microns before the ﬁnal alignment with tracks. The service half-cylinder also contains all the mechanical and electrical infrastructure needed to support, position, cool, power, control and read out the detector. In particular, it contains elec- tronics for providing bias voltage to the sensors, power to the read-out chips, signals for controlling the read-out chip via optical ﬁbers linking it to the control room, and laser drivers for sending the signals (address and energy deposition) off the detector to the data acquisition system. The service half-cylinder also provides the path for cooling ﬂuid necessary to remove the heat generated by the sensors and read-out chips. At the end of each service half-cylinder there is an annular aluminium ﬂange that contains holes to pass the power cables, cooling tubes, control and monitoring cables, and ﬁber optic read- out from intermediate patch panels to the FPix detector. The electronics cards needed for the operation of the detector are mounted on the inner surface of the half-cylinder. A picture of a half-cylinder is shown in ﬁgure 3.16. – 48 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004 Figure 3.17: Sketches of the two types of FPix panels showing the different sizes and numbers of the plaquettes on each (left side). A photograph of an actual 3-plaquette panel (right side). Forward pixel detection elements - the plaquettes The basic unit of construction for the forward pixel detector is the plaquette. A plaquette consists of a single pixel sensor bump-bonded to an appropriate number of Read-Out Chips (ROCs) and wire-bonded to a very-high-density-interconnect (VHDI) that provides power, control, and data connections. In order to cover the trapezoidal or pie-shaped panels without leaving cracks, ﬁve different sizes of plaquettes are needed. These are respectively 1 2, 2 3, 2 4, 1 5, 2 5, where the ﬁrst digit
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||refers to the number of rows and the second to the number of columns of read-out chips that are attached to a given sensor. The largest plaquette, the 2 5, has dimensions of 16 mm 35 mm. The panels on the side of the cooling channel closest to the IP contain 1 2, 2 3, 2 4, and 1 5 plaquettes or a total of 21 ROCs. The panels on the side of the cooling channels farthest from the IP contain 2 3, 2 4 and 2 5 type plaquettes with a total of 24 ROCs. The sensors are offset on the upstream and downstream panels so that there are no cracks in the coverage due to the ROC read-out periphery. The two types of panels are shown in ﬁgure 3.17. A total of 672 plaquettes are needed. The joining, or hybridization, of the pixel sensors and the pixel unit cells of the ROC is achieved by ﬁne-pitch bumping using Pb/Sn solder and then ﬂip-chip mating. The bumping is done on the 8” ROC wafers and the 4” sensor wafers. After bumping, the ROC wafers are thinned by backside grinding to 150 mm and then diced. Finally, each of the 5 different types of sensors are mated to the appropriate number of ROCs. The sensor with its ROCs bump-bonded to it is called a module. For FPix, the hybridization was done in industry. The fraction of broken, bridged, or missing bumps is at the level of a few 10 3. After delivery from the vendor, the bump-bonded pixel detector module is then installed on a Very High Density Interconnect (VHDI). The VHDI is a two-layer ﬂexible printed circuit, lam- inated to a 300 mm thick silicon substrate, whose trace geometry and characteristics (impedance, low intrinsic capacitance, and low cross-talk) have been
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||optimized for the intended use of convey- ing digital control and analog output signals to and from the sensors and ROCs. – 49 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004The VHDI is made as follows. A bulk 6” silicon wafer is laminated to a ﬂexible sheet con- taining several VHDI circuits. Passive components are also attached using surface-mount solder techniques. The wafer of populated circuits is then diced into individual circuits using a diamond saw. The circuits are then electrically tested. The hybridized pixel module is attached and wire bonded to a populated VHDI to become a plaquette. The joining is made using parallel plate ﬁxtures aligned on linear rails. The alignment of components is inspected using a coordinate measuring machine. A ﬂexible plate is used for ﬁne adjustments on the ﬁxtures resulting in alignments between joined components within 100 mm. The adhesive bond between plaquette components is made in a vacuum at 60°C, to soften the adhesive and prevent air entrapment. An air cylinder applies and controls the mating pressure, which is limited by the compression allowed on the bump-bonds. The effects of thermal cycling and radiation on the assembled plaquettes have been exten- sively tested. The tests demonstrate that the adhesive and the application method mitigate warping due to temperature changes, and provide reliable strength and thermal conductivity. Once plaquettes are mechanically joined, they are clamped in cassettes that accommodate all processing steps such as wirebonding which provides electrical connections between the ROCs and the VHDI. After wirebonding we encapsulate the feet of wirebonds. This encapsulation is necessary due to periodic I~dl~Bforces expected to occur during actual CMS operation. The encapsulant acts as a damping force on the wire, preventing large resonant oscillations to work harden the wire and cause eventual breakage [30]. Finally the plaquettes undergo quick testing at
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||room temperature. During this test the quality of the plaquettes is evaluated in terms of the characteristics of the sensor, the read-out chip, the number of bad pixels and missing bonds. The assembly and testing rate is optimized for a rate of six plaquettes per day. The completed plaquettes are subjected to a quick plug-in test. Then they are loaded into a Burn-In Box where they undergo 10 temperature cycles between 20°C and  15°C. These cycles can take up to 2 days to complete, depending upon the thermal load. During these cycles, the plaquettes are monitored for electrical operation. We have seen no failures during the cycling. After the burn-in process is completed, the plaquettes are subjected to a series of electrical tests to ensure their suitability for their eventual mounting on a panel. These tests, at the operating temperature of 15°C, include the functionality of the ROC, the integrity of the bump-bond, and the I-V characteristics of the sensor. Other tests measure the thresholds and noise characteristics of each pixel on the entire plaquette assembly, and the individual pixel thresholds are trimmed via the ROC capability. We have found that the pixel trim values from the plaquette test on each pixel remain valid even after subsequent steps of the assembly process. After testing the plaquette data is loaded into the Pixel Construction Database and the plaquettes are graded. We have three main categories of grades: • A - the plaquette is available for immediate mounting on a panel; • B - potential issues have been found during testing and need further analysis; • C - the plaquettes are unsuitable for mounting. The data on each B-grade plaquette are examined carefully. In many cases, the plaquettes are found to have missed being classiﬁed as A-grade due to very minor deﬁciencies (e.g.

These are “promoted” to A-grade and declared usable on panels. Current plaquette yields, based on an original grade of A or a promotion to A-grade from B, are in the 80% range, varying slightly according to plaquette size. Panel assembly A panel is formed from three or four plaquettes attached to an assembly of a High Density In- terconnect (HDI) laminated to a beryllium plate. The HDI is a three-layer ﬂexible printed circuit whose trace geometry and characteristics (impedance, low cross-talk) have been optimized for the intended use of transferring digital control and analog output signals. The process by which a panel is assembled is as follows. A single HDI circuit is laminated to a trapezoidal-shaped 0.5 mm thick beryllium plate. Passive components are attached using surface- mount solder techniques. The Token Bit Manager (TBM) is attached to the corner tab of the HDI using a die attach method and wire-bonding. After functional and burn-in tests with only the TBM, the individual plaquettes are attached to the HDI using adhesive for mechanical attachment and wire-bonds for electrical connection. There are four types of panels, a right and left 3-plaquette version, and a right and left 4- plaquette version. The right and left handed versions have their TBMs on opposite sides of the panel centerline. Both types are required so that no panel part projects past a line in the vertical plane. The reason for the “3” and “4” type panels is that they are eventually mounted on opposite side of a blade, and the gaps between plaquettes on one type are covered
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||by the active area of the other. A panel is built up out of several layers of components. These are shown in ﬁgure 3.18. The total number of panels in all eight half-disks is 192. Final detector assembly validation The panels are attached onto the front and back of the half-disk cooling channels. The 4-plaquette panels are mounted on the side closest to the interaction region (IR), and the 3-plaquette versions on the opposite side. The half-disk assembly is mounted onto the half-service cylinder and is again tested. – 51 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004Electronics chain Each HDI is connected to another ﬂexible printed circuit board, the adapter board. Each adapter board serves three blades (or 6 panels). One important purpose of the adapter board is to send and receive signals from the panels, which are mounted perpendicular to the axis of the service cylinder to and from the electronics mounted on the inner surface of the service cylinder. This is done by a pigtail at the end of each panel that plugs into connectors on the ﬁngers of the adapter board. The adapter board has three types of ASICs mounted on it. These are used to pass the clock, trigger and control data signals to each panel and return the received control signals back to the pFEC. The adapter board is connected to another printed circuit board, the port card, by a light- weight extension cable. These cables are of two types, a power cable which distributes the power to the ROCs and TBMs, and the HV bias to the sensors. The other cable is to transmit the pixel data and control signals to the panel from the port card. The port card is a low-mass printed circuit board. It houses the electronics needed to interface the front-end chips
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||with the VME electronics (the pFEC and pxFED) and power supplies located in the counting room. The port card transmits the clock signal, L1 trigger and slow control signals to the front end electronics. It distributes the power and bias voltages to the chips and sensors. It also monitors the currents and voltages as well as the temperature on some panels. These functions are done by various ASICs that are common to the CMS tracker. These ASICs include the DCU for monitoring, the TPLL for regenerating the trigger and timing signal, the gatekeeper for keeping the optical up and down links open as needed. To control and monitor the various ancillary chips and optohybrids, there is a CCU board for each half service cylinder, as described above. The port card contains the Analog Optohybrid (AOH). Each of the 6 laser diodes of the AOH chip receives data from one panel via its TBM and sends it over its own optical ﬁber to the Front end Driver (FED). The control of the ROCs is achieved through the Pixel Front End Controller. Optical signals are sent from it to the Digital Optohybrids on the port card, through the extension cables to the adapter board, then to the TBM on the panel, through the HDI and the VHDI to the ROCs. Power and monitoring Power connections are made from CAEN power supplies via cables that run through the ﬂange at the end of the half-cylinder away from the IR into a set of power/ﬁlter boards. From these boards, it is sent along wires to the port card, in the case of low voltages, and directly to the adapter board in the case of the sensor bias voltage. Monitoring points for temperature are distributed throughout the service cylinder. There are also humidity sensors. Additional
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||temperature sensors are mounted on the panels. High and low voltage and detector monitoring are connected to the DCS system described below. Testing Testing is a key element of quality assurance in the assembly process. While rework is possible, it is difﬁcult and error prone. At every step, we conﬁrm that we are using only “known good parts”. – 52 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004Testing must keep up with the driving assembly step, plaquette production. Full characterization of a plaquette requires hundreds of thousands of measurements. To accomplish this, we have developed special read-out hardware and software that can carry out these measurements quickly and efﬁciently. A software using a USB-based data acquisition scheme is employed when ﬂexibility is needed to develop measurement programs of modest complexity and duration, such as the burn-in procedure. For the most extensive measurements, including plaquette testing and characterization, we use a PCI-based system and a software program called Renaissance [31]. Final testing is performed using the real data-acquisition and control hardware and prototype data-acquisition software and constitutes an end-to-end system test. Detailed testing also estab- lishes an initial set of parameters for the many DACs and thresholds in the system. 3.2.6 Power supply All needed high and low DC voltages are generated by means of a commercial modular system of the type CAEN-EASY4000 . This system is also employed by the CMS silicon strip tracker for which the main regulating cards (A4601H) were custom designed [32]. Only small changes in hard- and ﬁrmware were necessary for adaptation to the pixel project. The core of this system, accessed through LAN, is located in the detector control room (USC55) and consists of one main controller (SY1527) containing 3 branch controllers (A1676A). The actual power supply cards are placed in two racks of 5 crates in close
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||proximity to the detector thanks to their radiation tolerance and magnetic ﬁeld resistance. This has been chosen in order to reduce power loss in the cables. The power supply crates are connected by ﬂat cables ( 100 m) to the branch controllers. They are fed by local 3-phase 230 V ACto 48 V DCmaster converters of each 2 kW (A3486H) also suited for operation at hostile environments. The crates house two types of electronic cards, one of 4 channels of 2.5 V/7 A (A4602) feeding the service electronics on the supply tubes (auxiliary power), while the other (A4603H) deliver 2 complex channels of each 2 low (1.75 V/7 A and 2.5 V/15 A) and 2 high voltage lines ( 600 V/20 mA) for ROC and sensor biasing respectively. Each of these channels contains ﬂoat- ing pulse-width-modulated DC/DC switching transformers with a common ground return for the 1.75 and 2.5 V lines. The isolation resistance (ground return versus earth on the racks) is typically 100Wat 5 MHz. Every card is controlled by an optically decoupled microprocessor for setting and measuring voltages, currents, ramp times, trip parameters, interlocks and others. The DC levels are regulated over sense lines. The reaction time of the sensing circuit (typi- cally 200 ms) is subject to ﬁne tuning to comply with capacitive load, cable impedance and length (typically 50 m). The line drop in the cables amounts to roughly 2 V , while the regulators would allow for a maximum of 6 V . Fourteen A4602 cards, yielding 40 independent channels of auxiliary power, feed the 32 slots of the barrel service tubes with each 2 DOHs and 6 AOHs as well as 4 groups of each 12 port cards of the forward half disks. The main supplies of 112 complex LV and HV channels (56 A4603H
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||cards) feed the 64 barrel groups (192 ROCs, this contains groups with half size modules) of each 12 detector modules, and 48 forward groups (135 ROCs) of each 3 disk blades. Each of these groups draws a typical current of 4.6 A on the analogue (1.75 V) and 9 A on the digital (2.5 V) line respectively. The large current reserve of the supplies is needed to comply with conditions during bootstrapping where the ROCs remain brieﬂy in an undeﬁned state. It was – 53 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004veriﬁed that the regulators undergo a smooth transition from the constant-voltage to the constant- current regime if the programmed current limits are approached. Beside microprocessor controlled actions (1 s) fast over-current security is guaranteed by various solid state fuses (10 ms) as well as crowbars (100 ms) for over-voltage. Noise levels are typically 5 mV ppon the LV and 50 mV ppon the HV outputs which can easily be accepted thanks to the LV regulators in the ROCs and the intrinsically small sensor capacitances respectively. Of major concern in the overall design were fast drops in the digital current con- sumption (2.5 V line) in case of low ROC activity like in orbit gaps. Due to the cable inductance a typical current drop of 2 A per group generates over-voltage spikes at the module level in the order of some V olts depending on local buffer capacitors. The integrity of the cable-module-ROC circuit was therefore checked by a full simulation in SPICE together with measurements on pulsed current loads. This served for the designs of the cables and the electronic layout, e.g. grounding or HV distribution. (In one sector layer-1 modules are fed by one line while layer-2,3 modules are commonly fed by the other.) Finally a 6 4 mm2shielded copper
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||cable was chosen for the 40 m from the power supply cards to the patch panel (PP1) located in the HCAL with alternating current directions between adjacent lines. Two twisted pair lines for the senses and a bunch of 10 commonly shielded lines for HV are contained in the same cable complex (0.1 mm2). Inductance, capacitance and characteristic impedance between two of the main lines were measured to be 6 mH/m, 0.13 nF/m and 24 Wrespectively. The 4 m connection between PP1 and PP0 (tracker bulkhead) uses Al conductors in the cable. The auxiliary power cable is also shielded and contains 26 0.75 mm2and 4 twisted pair copper lines with 0.1 mm2for the sense wires. 3.2.7 Cooling The power consumption per pixel amounts to around 55 mW, including about 13 mW from the sensor leakage current at ﬁnal ﬂuences of 6 1014/cm2. For the total of66 million pixels this adds up to 3.6 kW. The power load on the aluminium cooling tubes is therefore expected to be about 50 W/m. The sensor temperature will be maintained at around  10°C. As for the strip detectors, liquid phase cooling with C 6F14is used. To keep the temperature increase of the coolant below 2°C, a total ﬂow rate of 1 litre/s is required. The pixel system is cooled by a total of 18 cooling loops: 10 for the barrel and 4 for each of the two end disk systems. For the barrel, the coolant enters at +zand exits at z, or vice versa. The coolant for the two disk sets on each side of the interaction region is supplied and reclaimed from the same zside. One barrel loop feeds in parallel 9 thin-walled aluminium pipes, each cooling 8 modules in series. One disk loop cools in parallel one quarter of each of the 2
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||disks; inside the quarter disks the 6 blade loops are connected serially. The coolant ﬂow at the pixel modules is turbulent. The total lengths of the cooling loops starting from and returning to the pixel cooling rack amount to about 80 m, resulting in pressure drops of below 2 bar. 3.2.8 Slow controls The safe operation of the barrel and forward pixel detectors is guaranteed by the CMS Pixel slow controls system (DCS). Its tasks are to monitor temperatures and humidities at different locations – 54 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004of the detector and to monitor and control the high and low voltages necessary for operation of the on-detector electronics. The monitoring of temperatures and humidities is based on a commercial Siemens S7–300 modular mini Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) system. The Siemens S7–300 system mon- itors a total of 192 temperature and 8 humidity sensors installed in the Pixel barrel and forward endcap disks. For the temperature sensors, platinum resistance temperature detection sensors with a nominal resistance of 1 kW (Pt1000 RTD) have been chosen. The measurement of humidity is based on detecting the water vapor induced shear stress in a small polymer element that is con- nected to a Wheatstone Bridge piezoresistor circuit [33]. This circuit provides a small (mV) output signal that is linearly proportional to relative humidity (RH) between the full range of 0% to 100% RH and is ampliﬁed by the same kind of conditioning electronics that is used by the silicon strip tracker. The PLC of the Siemens S7–300 system is programmed in the Statement List (STL) language [34] to convert the currents and voltages of the temperature and humidity sensors into calibrated physical units (i.e. degrees Celsius for temperatures and percentages for humidities). For the purpose of avoiding damage to the detector in case
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||the cooling system (dry air supply) fails, routines are programmed within the PLC to interlock the CAEN power supplies (shut-off the cooling) in that case. An additional 96 Pt1000 temperature sensors are read out via the data-acquisition (DAQ) system, together with the temperature dependent voltage sources integrated into each one of the pixel read-out chips. The temperatures recorded by the DAQ system are passed to the slow controls system by means of a dedicated software interface [35]. The Barrel and Forward Pixel slow controls system is integrated into the PVSS graphical user interface (chapter 9) of the main CMS DCS. 3.3 Silicon strip tracker 3.3.1 Silicon sensors The sensor elements in the strip tracker are single sided p-on-n type silicon micro-strip sen- sors [36, 37]. They have been manufactured on 6 inch wafers in a standard planar process, leading to signiﬁcant cost reduction per unit area when compared to the more traditional 4 inch wafers. The base material is ndoped ﬂoat zone silicon with h100i crystal orientation. This crystal ori- entation was preferred over the more common h111i orientation because measurements [38] have shown that the built-up of surface charge on h100i wafers due to irradiation is much smaller and consequently irradiation causes less inter-strip capacitance increase on this material. In TIB/TID and on the inner 4 rings of the TECs (ﬁgure 3.1), thin sensors of (32020)mm wafer thickness are used, with substrate resistivity of r=1:55 3:25kW cm. TOB and the outer 3 rings of the TECs are equipped with thicker sensors of (50020)mm thickness, with substrate resistivity of r=4 8kW cm. Due to the single sided processing, these sensors show a signiﬁcant bow, which is required to be less than 100 mm. A uniform n+implantation on the back side of the wafers, covered by aluminium, forms an ohmic contact which is
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||connected to positive voltage up to about 500 V . Those sensors which are penetrated by the beams of the laser alignment system (section 3.3.7) feature a 10 mm hole in the – 55 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004back side metalization, as well as anti-reﬂective coating in order to achieve transmission through up to four sensors with a sufﬁcient signal on a ﬁfth sensor. On the front side, strip shaped diodes are formed by p+implantation into the ntype bulk. Due to the radiation damage to the crystal lattice, the bulk material will undergo type inversion and change to ptype. At this point, the pnjunction moves from the strip side of the wafer to the rear side contact. Each implanted strip is covered by an aluminium strip from which it is electrically insulated by means of a silicon oxide and nitride multilayer. This integrated capacitor allows for AC coupling of the signals from the strips to the read-out electronics, which is thus protected from the high leakage currents after irradiation. Each metal strip has two bond pads on each end, which are used to make a wire bond connection to the read-out chip and in case of the daisy chained sensors to make a wire bond connection between the two sensors in one detector module. For testing purposes there is also a DC pad connected to the p+implant. Each strip implant is connected via a (1:50:5)MW polysilicon bias resistor to a p+bias ring which encloses the strip region and also deﬁnes the active area of the sensor. For all sensors in the CMS strip tracker the ratio of p+implant width over strip pitch is w=p=0:25, leading to a uniform total strip capacitance per unit length of about 1: 2 pF/cm across all sensor geometries [38]. The actual w=pvalue was chosen in
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||order to minimize the strip capacitance while still maintaining a good high voltage behaviour of the sensor. The aluminium strips feature a metal overhang of 4 to 8 mm on each side of the strip which pushes the high ﬁeld region into the silicon oxide where the breakdown voltage is much higher, leading to stable high voltage operation. For the same reason, the bias ring is surrounded by a ﬂoating guard ring p+implant. It gradually degrades the electric ﬁeld between the n+implant at the cut edge of the sensor and the bias ring, which are at backplane potential (high voltage) and ground, respectively. Figure 3.19 shows the layout of a corner of the active region of a sensor. In order to equip all regions in the CMS tracker, 15 different sensor geometries are needed [36] (ﬁgure 3.19): two rectangular sensor types each for TIB and TOB, and 11 wedge- shaped sensor types for TEC and TID. They have either 512 or 768 strips, reﬂecting the read-out modularity of 256 channels (two 128-channel front-end chips multiplexed to one read-out channel). Since the sensors are fabricated on 6 inch wafers, they can be made rather large. Typical dimen- sions are for instance about 6 12cm2and 109cm2in the inner and outer barrel, respectively. The total number of silicon sensors in the strip tracker is 24 244, making up a total active area of 198m2, with about 9.3 million of strips [36]. 3.3.2 Read-out system The signals from the silicon sensors are ampliﬁed, shaped, and stored by a custom integrated cir- cuit, the APV25 [39]. Upon a positive ﬁrst level trigger decision the analogue signals of all chan- nels are multiplexed and transmitted via optical ﬁbers to Front End Driver (FED) boards in the service cavern where the analogue to digital conversion takes place.
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||This read-out scheme brings the full analogue information to a place where it can be used for accurate pedestal and common mode subtraction as well as data sparsiﬁcation. Clock, trigger, and control signals are transmitted by optical links as well. A schematic view of the silicon strip tracker read-out scheme is given in ﬁgure 3.20. This analogue read-out scheme was chosen for several reasons: optimal spatial reso- – 56 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004 Guard ring Bias ring Bias resistors DC pads AC pads Figur e 3.19: Left panel: drawing of one corner of the active region of a wedge-shaped silicon strip sensor for the tracker endcaps. Right panel: silicon sensor geometries utilized in the CMS tracker. In the outer layers the sensors are paired to form a single module, as shown in the ﬁgure. The Inner Barrel and Outer Barrel sensors exist in two types, of same area and different pitch. The sensors utilized for the ﬁrst inner ring exist in two different versions, one for TID and one for TEC, respectively. (Only the TEC version is shown.) Figur e 3.20: Read-out scheme of the CMS tracker. lution from charge sharing, operational robustness and ease of monitoring due to the availability of the full analogue signal, robustness against possible common mode noise, less custom radiation hard electronics and reduced material budget as the analogue to digital conversion and its power needs are shifted out of the tracker volume. – 57 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004Front-end ASICs The APV25 has been designed in an IBM 0: 25mm bulk CMOS process. Compared to processes with bigger feature sizes, the thin gate oxide inherent to this deep sub-micron process is much less affected by radiation induced charge-up and thereby, in conjunction with special design techniques, ensures radiation tolerance [40]. The APV25 has
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||128 read-out channels, each consisting of a low noise and power charge sensitive pre-ampliﬁer, a 50ns CR-RC type shaper and a 192 element deep analogue pipeline which samples the shaped signals at the LHC frequency of 40MHz. This pipeline is used to store the data for a trigger latency of up to 4 ms and to buffer it. A subsequent stage can either pass the signal as sampled at the maximum of the 50ns pulse (peak mode) or form a weighted sum of three consecutive samples which effectively reduces the shaping time to 25ns (deconvolution mode). The latter is needed at high luminosity in order to conﬁne the signals to the correct LHC bunch crossing. The pulse shape depends linearly (linearity better than 5%) on the signal up to a charge corresponding to 5 minimum ionizing particles (MIPs, one MIP is equivalent to 25 000 electrons in this case), with a gradual fall off beyond. When a trigger is received, the analogue data from all 128 channels of the appropriate time slice in the pipeline are multiplexed and output at a rate of 20 MS/s (mega-samples per second) as a differential bi-directional current signal, together with a digital header. Due to the tree structure of the analogue multiplexer the order in which the channels are output is non-consecutive and therefore re-ordering is necessary prior to the actual data processing. An internal calibration circuit allows to inject charge with programmable amplitude and delay into the ampliﬁer inputs in order to be able to monitor the pulse shape. The APV25 needs supply voltages of 1.25 V and 2.5 V with a typical current consumption of about 65 mA and 90 mA respectively, leading to a total power consumption of typically around 300 mW for one APV25 or 2.3 mW per channel. The
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||noise of the analogue read-out chain is dominated by the front end MOSFET transistor in the APV25. Measurements have shown that the total noise for an APV25 channel depends linearly on the connected detector capacitance Cdet. The equivalent noise charge is found to be ENC peak =270e +38e=pFCdetin peak mode and ENC deconv =430e +61e=pFCdetin deconvolution mode, both measured at room temperature [39]. Mainly due to the MOSFET characteristics, the noise reduces with temperature approximately as ENCp T. Therefore, the noise at operating temperature is about 10% lower. More than 100 APV25 chips from all production lots have been irradiated with X-rays to 10 Mrad ionizing dose, in excess of the expectation for 10 years of LHC operation. No signiﬁcant degradation in pulse shape or noise level has been observed. The APV25 is fabricated on 8 inch wafers with 360 chips per wafer. More than 600 wafers corresponding to 216 000 chips have been manufactured and probe-tested. After initial yield prob- lems were solved, an average yield of 88% was achieved. Another custom ASIC, the APVMUX, is used to multiplex the data streams from two APV25 chips onto one optical channel by interleaving the two 20 MS/s streams into one 40 MS/s stream, which is then sent to a laser driver of the optical links. One APVMUX chip contains 4 such multiplexers. – 58 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004Optical links Analogue optical links are used to transmit the data streams from the tracker to the service cavern over a distance of about 100 m at 40 MS/s. Likewise, the digital timing and control signals (see below) are transmitted by digital optical links running at 40 Mb/s [41]. Optical links are superior to an electrical distribution scheme mainly since they have minimal impact on the material budget and are immune to
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||electrical interference. The transmitters are commercially available multi-quantum- well InGaAsP edge-emitting devices, selected for their good linearity, low threshold current and proven reliability. Epitaxially grown planar InGaAs photo-diodes are used as receivers. The optical ﬁber itself is a standard, single-mode, non dispersion shifted telecommunication ﬁber. The ﬁbers are grouped in ribbons of 12 ﬁbers which in turn are packaged in a stack of 8 inside a 96-way ribbon cable, which features a small diameter (< 10mm) and a low bending radius (8cm). For the analogue data link up to three transmitters are connected to a laser driver ASIC on an Analogue Opto-Hybrid (AOH), one of which sits close to each detector module. The electrical signals from the APVMUX are transmitted differentially over a distance of a few centimeters to the laser driver, which modulates the laser diode current accordingly and provides a programmable bias current to the diode. For the bi-directional digital optical link a set of two receivers and two transmitters is mounted on a Digital Opto-Hybrid (DOH), converting the optical signals to electrical LVDS [42] and vice versa. Front End Drivers The strip tracker Front End Driver (FED) is a 9U VME module which receives data from 96 optical ﬁbres, each corresponding to 2 APV25 or 256 detector channels [45]. All 96 ﬁbres are processed in parallel. The optical signals are converted to electrical levels by opto-receivers [43] and then digitized by a 40MHz, 10 bit ADC. The ADC sampling point for each ﬁbre can be programmed independently in 1 ns steps. After auto-synchronization to the APV data stream, pedestal correc- tions are applied and the common mode subtracted. The common mode correction is calculated for each trigger and each APV separately. The samples are then re-ordered to restore the physical sequence of detector channels which is essential
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||for the following step of cluster ﬁnding. Pedestal values for each detector channel and thresholds for cluster ﬁnding are stored in look up tables. The digital functionality of the FED is implemented in FPGAs and can therefore be adjusted with con- siderable ﬂexibility. In zero suppression mode, which is the standard for normal data taking, the output of the FED is a list of clusters with address information and signal height (8-bit resolution) for each strip in the cluster, thus passing to the central DAQ only those objects which are relevant for track reconstruction and physics analysis. In this way an input data rate per FED of about 3.4 GB/s, at LHC design luminosity, is reduced to roughly 50 MB/s per percent strip occupancy. Other modes are, however, available which suppress one or more steps in the processing chain and therefore transmit additional data to the central DAQ to be used mainly for debugging and system analysis. There are a total of 450 FEDs in the ﬁnal system. – 59 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004Control and monitoring Clock, trigger and control data are transmitted to the tracker by Front End Controller (FEC) cards [44]. These are VME modules, located in the service cavern, as close as possible to the tracker in order to reduce trigger latency. They receive clock and trigger signals from the global Timing Trigger and Command (TTC) system and distribute those as well as control signals via dig- ital optical links and the digital opto-hybrids to LVDS token ring networks (control rings) inside the tracker volume. Several Communication and Control Units (CCU) [46] participate in one token ring. These are custom ASICs which interface the ring network to the front-end chips. One CCU is mounted on a Communication and Control Unit Module (CCUM) and is dedicated to
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||a set of detector modules. A combined clock and trigger signal is distributed to Phase Locked Loop (PLL) chips [47] on each detector module while the industry standard I2C protocol [48] is used to send control signals to the APV chips as well as to the other ancillary chips. One CCU can control up to 16 units so that one FEC ring typically controls a set of several tens of detector modules. The PLL chips decode the trigger signals and provide a very low jitter, phase adjustable clock signal to the local electronics. Detector Control Unit (DCU) ASICs [49] on the detector modules are used to monitor the low voltages on the hybrid, the silicon sensor leakage current, and the temperatures of the silicon sensors, the hybrid and the DCU itself. For this purpose, each DCU contains eight 12 bit ADCs. The DCUs are read out through the control rings and digital links so that these readings are only available when the control rings and the detector modules are powered. Hybrids The front-end read-out electronics for a detector module is mounted onto a multi chip module called hybrid [50]. Due to the different detector module geometries 12 different types of hybrids are needed in the CMS silicon strip tracker. Each hybrid carries 4 or 6 APV25 read-out chips which are mounted as bare dies, and one APVMUX chip, one PLL chip and one DCU chip which are packaged components. The main features of the hybrid are to distribute and ﬁlter the supply voltages to the chips, to route clock, control and data lines between the chips and to remove the heat from the chips into the cooling system. No high voltage is present on the CMS tracker hybrids. The hybrid substrate is fabricated as a four layer polyimide copper multilayer
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||ﬂex circuit (ﬁgure 3.21). It is laminated onto a ceramic (Al 2O3) carrier plate using double sided acrylic adhesive. A poly- imide cable is integrated into the layout of the hybrid. The minimal feature sizes are 120 mm for via diameter and line width. Large metalized through holes under the chips transfer the heat to the un- derlying ceramic plate, from where it is removed through the frame of the module into the cooling system. Three different ﬂex circuit types (one each for TIB/TID, TOB and TEC) combined with different geometries of the ceramic plates, different connector orientations and different number of APV25 chips (4 or 6) make up the total of 12 different hybrid ﬂavours. Power supplies Silicon strip modules are grouped into 1944 detector power groups in order to share the power services. Each group is supplied by a power supply unit (PSU) [32], featuring two low-voltage – 60 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004 Figure 3.21: Front-end hybrid layout (example for TEC shown on the left) and arrangement of layers. regulators, respectively 1.25 V (up to 6 A) and 2.5 V (up to 13 A), and two high-voltage regu- lators (0-600 V , up to 12 mA). All regulators are “ﬂoating” (return line isolated from the local earth). The two low-voltage channels share the same return line and use the sensing wire tech- nique to compensate, up to 4 V , the voltage drop along the cables. The two high-voltage regulators are fanned out at the PSU exit into 8 lines; each silicon strip sensor is connected to one of these lines. Two PSU are combined into one power supply module (PSM, A4601H model). In total 984 A4601H boards are needed to power the detector groups; they are located on 129 EASY 4000 crates, disposed on 29 racks,
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||around 10 m away from the beam crossing region, and operate in a “hostile” radiation and magnetic ﬁeld environment, powering the detector through 50-m-long low impedance cables [32]. The 356 control rings require a separate power at 2.5 V . This is pro- vided by a different set of 110 control power supply modules (A4602, four 2.5 V channels per module), fully integrated in the same system of the A4601H units and located on the same crates. Both A4601H and A4602 units require two distinct 48V power sources, one source (48Vp) for the regulators, the other (48Vs) for the service electronics. They are both provided by AC-DC convert- ers, CAENs A3486 (“MAO”), disposed on the same racks. Each EASY 4000 crate hosts up to 9 boards (A4601H mixed to A4602) and provides 48Vp and 48Vs rails, interlock and general reset bus lines. The ﬁrst slot in the crate (slot 0) hosts one interlock-card, which interfaces the interlock and reset lines to the control and safety systems (section 3.3.8). The average power consumption of each silicon strip module with 6 (4) APV25 chips is about 2662 mW (1845 mW). The total power supplied by A4601H and A4602 boards is approximately 68 kW, of which nearly 50% is dissipated on power cables. The power consumption is foreseen to increase with the aging of the detector; the power supply system is dimensioned to cope with up to 60% increase of the low-voltage currents, corresponding to a total consumption of nearly 150 kW. – 61 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004 silicon sensors front-end hybrid frame (carbon fibre)Kapton foil cross piece (graphite)ceramicpitch adapterfar sensor near sensor Figur e 3.22: Left panel: exploded view of a module housing two sensors.

The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||modules Module design The silicon strip tracker is composed of 15 148 detector modules distributed among the four differ- ent subsystems (TIB, TID, TOB, TEC). Each module carries either one thin (320 mm) or two thick (500 mm) silicon sensors from a total of 24 244 sensors. All modules are supported by a frame made of carbon ﬁber or graphite, depending on the position in the tracker. A Kapton circuit layer is used to insulate the silicon from the module frame and to provide the electrical connection to the sensor back plane, i.e. bias voltage supply and temperature probe read-out. In addition the module frame carries the front-end hybrid and the pitch adapter. Figure 3.22 shows an exploded view and a photograph of a TEC module. Modules for the inner barrel, the inner disks and rings 1 to 4 in the endcaps are equipped with one sensor, modules in the outer barrel and rings 5 to 7 in the endcaps have two sensors. In the case of two sensors, their corresponding strips are connected electrically via wire bonds. Depending on the geometry and number of sensors the active area of a module varies between 6243.1 mm2(TEC, ring 1) and 17202.4 mm2(TOB module). In total 29 different module designs, 15 different sensor designs and twelve different hybrid designs are used in TIB, TOB, TID and TEC. For alignment purposes special modules are prepared with etched holes in the aluminium back plane to allow a laser ray to traverse up to ﬁve modules. The module frame provides the stability, safety and heat removal capability needed in the sensor support and carries the read-out electronics. In addition it has to remove the heat generated in the electronics and the silicon sensor(s) into the cooling points. In the endcaps the frame for the one-sensor
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||modules is U-shaped and made of (780 5)mm thick graphite (FE779 carbon). For the two-sensor modules a similar U-shaped support structure is obtained by gluing two (640 40)mm thick carbon ﬁber legs (K13D2U CFC, 5 125mm fabric, cyanate ester resin (CE3)) on a 800 mm thick graphite cross-piece (FE779 carbon) which holds the front end electronics. In the inner barrel a 550 mm thick carbon ﬁber frame that surrounds the silicon sensor on all sides is used . For the TOB, U-shaped module frames are obtained by gluing two carbon ﬁber legs (K13D2U CFC, 5125mm fabric, cyanate ester resin (CE3)) on a carbon ﬁber cross piece made of the same material. – 62 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004Both graphite and carbon ﬁber fulﬁl the requirements of high stiffness, low mass, efﬁcient heat removal from the sensors, and radiation hardness. Differences in the expansion coefﬁcients need to be compensated by the glue joint between the frames and the silicon. Several types of glues are used in module construction which all comply with the requirements of radiation hardness, good thermal conductivity and thermal stability. Among them are e. g. Epoxy AW 106 (Araldit, Novartis), silicone glue RTV 3140 (Dow Corning) to compensate for different thermal expansion coefﬁcients and the conductive glue EE 129-4 (Polytec) between the silicon sensor back plane and the HV lines on the Kapton bias strips (see below). Different types of aluminium inserts and precision bushings in the module frames are used to position and attach the modules to the larger support structures with high precision. TIB/TID and TEC modules are mounted using four points, two being high precision bushings that allow for a mounting precision of better than 20 mm while all four provide thermal contact between the module and the cooling pipes. For TOB modules two Cu-Be
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||springs give the precision positioning and four screws ensure thermal contact. The high voltage supply to the silicon back plane is provided by Kapton bias circuits running along the legs of the modules between the silicon sensor and the carbon ﬁber support frame. The connection of the bias voltage to the back plane is done via wire bonds. Thermal probes are placed on the Kapton foil to measure the temperature of the silicon. The glue joint between the temperature sensor and the back plane is done with the silicone glue RTV 3140. The pitch adapter between the front end hybrid and the silicon sensor adjusts the strip pitch of the sensor (80 mm–205 mm depending on sensor type) to the APV pitch of 44 mm. It also allows placing the heat producing front end electronics farther away from the silicon sensors. A pitch adapter for TOB and TEC consists of a 550 mm thick glass substrate (Schott D263 glass), cut to the correct dimensions, with a pattern of low resistivity aluminium strips. For TIB 300 mm thick glass (Corning 1737F or G glass) is used. The 10 mm narrow lines are etched on a (1.0–1.5) mm thick aluminium layer deposited on a chromium base, resulting in less than 25 mW=. Module assembly and testing Sensors and front end hybrids are glued to the frames by high precision gantry robots. The compo- nents are aligned by cameras surveying special ﬁducial marks with a pattern recognition algorithm. In total seven institutes shared the responsibility for the assembly of all modules. The assembly rate was about 20 modules per day per gantry robot. A positioning precision of approximately 10 mm (RMS) has been achieved and one example from the quality control can be seen in ﬁgure 3.23. Thin wire wedge bonding is used
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||in several places on the modules to make electrical con- nections: APV chip to front-end hybrid, APV chip to pitch adapter, pitch adapter to sensor, sensor to sensor (in case of two-sensor-modules), bias voltage connection to the sensor back plane. In total 15 institutes (bonding centers) shared the responsibility for wire bonding all modules. The bonding rate was approximately 1 Hz. Bonding wire (99% aluminium, 1% silicon) with a diameter of 25 mm was used for all connections. For the TEC and TOB modules the line of bonding wires connecting the hybrid pitch adapter to the silicon strips, and in the case of two sensor modules the strips of the two sensors, can be damaged by vibration during transport. As a protection for the TEC modules the silicon is glued – 63 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004 Figure 3.23: A typical residual distribution (in mm) for a reference point on the modules is shown for the different module assembly centers, indicating a precision of 10 mm (RMS) in the module production. to a supporting strip (400 mm thin ceramic Al 2O3) which in the case of the pitch adapter-sensor connection is also glued to the graphite cross piece. The reinforcement for the TOB modules was done by dispensing Sylgard 186 glue on the backside of the modules, between the two sensors and between the near sensor and the edge of the hybrid. For the TOB modules the sensor-sensor bonds and the backside APV bondings are encapsulated by Sylgard 186 glue across the bonding wires. For TIB modules no reinforcement was done. After wire bonding each module was tested and graded, using the ARC system [51]. A detailed description of all tests performed and the acceptance criteria for good channels is given in the reference. Modules were graded A if fewer
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||than 1% of the channels were failing the quality acceptance criteria (due to high noise, open bondings, oxide defects) and B if the failure rate was less than 2%. The remaining modules were graded C and were not used in the experiment. Other reasons to reject modules were imperfect mechanical precision or poor high voltage behaviour. All relevant test results are stored in the central CMS tracker data base. The yield of module production was greater than 97%. 3.3.4 Tracker Inner Barrel and Disks (TIB/TID) Introduction and mechanics The Tracker Inner Barrel (TIB) consists of four concentric cylinders placed at radii of 255.0 mm, 339.0 mm, 418.5 mm, and 498.0 mm respectively from the beam axis that extend from  700 mm to +700 mm along the zaxis. The two innermost layers host double sided modules with a strip pitch of 80 mm, while the outer two layers host single sided modules with a strip pitch of 120 mm. Each cylinder is subdivided into four sub-assemblies ( z, up/down) for ease of handling and integration. Each of these sub-assemblies (half-shells) hosts an independent array of services from cooling to electronics and thus can be fully equipped and tested before being mechanically coupled to each other during ﬁnal assembly. – 64 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004 TIB/TID + with the margherita .Layer 4 shellsService cylinder (disks are hidden inside) Electrical power patch panels Optical fibres patch panel SilicondetectorsFigure 3.24: Schematic drawing of the TIB/TID+ subassembly. This structure and its twin (TIB/TID-) nest inside the Tracker Outer Barrel (TOB), one for each end. Services routed out from the margherita consist of copper cables for powering and slow controls, optical ﬁbers for signals and controls and also cooling ﬂuid supply lines made of aluminium tubing. Two service cylinders are coupled to the ends of
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||TIB (referring to +zor z) which end in a service distribution disk called the margherita (see below). These service cylinders play a dual role: one is to route out services from the shells to the margherita, the other is to support the Tracker Inner Disks (TID) which sit inside them. Figure 3.24 shows a schematic drawing of one half TIB/TID structure together with its corresponding margherita. The TID are assemblies of three disks placed in zbetween800mm and900mm. The disks are identical and each one consists of three rings which span the radius from roughly 200 mm to 500 mm. The two innermost rings host back-to-back modules while the outer one hosts single sided ones. Just like the TIB shells each individual ring can be fully equipped and tested inde- pendently of the others before ﬁnal assembly. Together the full TIB/TID guarantee hermetical coverage up to pseudorapidity h=2:5. All mechanical parts like shells, disks and service cylinders are made of high strength low deformation carbon ﬁber chosen both for its lightness and its low material budget. The margherita is instead made of conventional G-10 ﬁber epoxy with 30 mm copper on both sides. The silicon detector modules are mounted directly on the structure’s shells and rings. Thus, while a large number of modules has to be integrated and tested at any one time, the approach chosen allows for far greater precision of assembly. The individual components of a TIB shell, – 65 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004some of which not only service the silicon detector needs but also deﬁne its geometric position in space, will be described in some detail in next paragraphs. Cooling The cooling circuits must be able to efﬁciently cool the detectors with a cooling liquid temperature down to about 25°C, while keeping the material budget as low as possible.
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||For the TIB/TID the decision was made to use aluminium piping of 6mm cross section and 0: 3mm wall thickness. These pipes are bent into loops and soldered to inlet/outlet manifolds which connect several loops in parallel. The thermal connection between pipes and silicon modules is made with aluminium ledges which are glued to the pipes. On each ledge there are two threaded M1 holes onto which the modules are tightened. For the TIB each loop hosts three modules placed in straight row (ﬁgure 3.25), while in the TID arrangements are more varied even though the number of modules per cooling loop is similar. Since the position of the ledges deﬁnes the position in space of the modules, after the glue has hardened the whole half cylinder is surveyed with a precision measuring machine. Before gluing, the circuits are tested individually for leaks both at cold temperatures (  30°C) and at high pressure (20 bars). It is only after the survey that the TIB cylinders (or TID disks) are available for the integration of the electrical parts including the detector modules. The dimensions of the cooling circuit vary from layer to layer and depend on the amount of power dissipated by the modules used for that speciﬁc layer. The cooling circuits vary from a minimum of four loops (12 modules equivalent) for the double sided layers to a maximum of 15 loops for the outer single sided ones where individual module heat dissipation is much lower. The TIB/TID uses a total of 70 independent cooling circuits so that in case of an accidental break in one of the circuits only a small part of the tracker is affected. The TIB thus is organized in three module ladders (the cooling loop) which cover the outer and inner surface of the four
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||layers. The same concept applies to the TID with the only difference that the number of modules per cooling loop varies with the ring radius. The electrical grouping which we now describe takes this mechanical distribution into account. Electrical grouping The modules have been grouped together electrically. The basic group consists of three modules which sit on any given cooling loop (ﬁgure 3.25). The three modules are interconnected through a Kapton circuit (mother cable) through which powering, detector biasing and controls are dis- tributed. At the top of a mother cable sits a CCUM which takes care of clock, trigger and I2C distribution. These mother cables are then electrically joined in a more complex group called the control ring which distributes trigger, clock and slow control signals to the CCUMs. Control ring groups never straddle two different cooling loops and are dimensioned so that a reasonable com- promise between granularity and complexity is achieved. Control rings in the TIB/TID make use of a unit called the DOHM (Digital opto-hybrid module) which receives all the signals from the optical ﬁbers coming from the front end controllers (FEC) and converts them to electrical LVDS signals that are then distributed to up to 45 detector modules (15 mother cables) via CCUs. Given the high number of modules belonging to a Control Ring, TIB/TID has implemented redundancy in its DOHM hardware. – 66 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004 iFigure 3.25: Three TIB modules mounted on a layer 3 shell. The Kapton mother cable runs underneath. A CCUM module at the end of the string interfaces the modules to the control ring. Also visible are the three analog opto-hybrids (see text) and ﬁbers. Modules have been grouped together to keep the number of power supplies down to a man- ageable level. The smallest power group
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||consists of three modules (one mother cable) while the largest comprises up to 12 modules (four mother cables). Power groups are contained within a con- trol ring (i.e. there is no straddling across control ring boundaries) and are fed by a speciﬁc power supply unit (PSU) developed for the tracker which also supplies HV biasing for the detectors. Analog signals from the detector front end are converted to optical by analog opto-hybrids which sit next to the silicon modules and are connected directly to the front end hybrids. Thus the system is completely optically decoupled from the DAQ which helps preserve signal integrity while avoiding ground loops. Grounding of the TIB/TID relies on the cooling circuits which are made of aluminium. The return current wires are connected to the cooling manifolds for all mother cables and DOHMs. The cooling inlet and outlet pipes run along the service cylinder across the margherita, making electrical contact with it. Outside the tracker volume these pipes are then connected to the CMS detector ground. Power cable shields are connected to the margherita which hosts all of the connectors. All detector modules have their own carbon ﬁber frame directly connected to the front end hybrid local ground. The shells are grounded through the cooling manifolds. 3.3.5 Tracker Outer Barrel (TOB) Mechanical structure and layout The Tracker Outer Barrel consists of a single mechanical structure (wheel ) supporting 688 self- contained sub-assemblies, called rods. The wheel is composed by four identical disks joined by three outer and three inner cylin- ders (ﬁgure 3.26). Disks and cylinders are made of carbon ﬁber epoxy laminate. The cylinders have a core of aramid-ﬁber honeycomb. The joints between disks and cylinders are realized with aluminium elements glued to the carbon ﬁber parts on precision ﬁxtures, and then bolted together. Each
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||of the disks contains 344 openings, in which the rods are inserted. Each rod is supported by two disks, and two rods cover the whole length of the TOB along the zaxis. The wheel has a length of 2180 mm, and inner and outer radii of 555 mm and 1160 mm, respectively. With cabling at its two ends the TOB has a total length of 2360 mm. The openings in the disks form six detection layers with average radii of 608, 692, 780, 868, 965, 1080 mm. Within each layer, the centers of gravity of the rods are displaced by 16 mm with respect to the average radius of the layer, thus allowing for overlap in fand therefore full coverage within each layer. The rod mechanics are designed in such a way to implement overlap of the silicon sensors at z=0. In each layer, the – 67 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004 Figure 3.26: Picture of the TOB wheel. overlap in the r-fview between neighboring rods is always larger than 1.5 mm or 12 strips, while the overlap around z=0 is precisely 1.5 mm. Inside the disk openings, the rod support spheres are held by precision elements made of polyetherimide plastic that are glued to the carbon ﬁber structure. The four disks have all been assembled in a temperature-controlled room on one single precision table, ensuring a precision on the relative positions of the rod holding elements and the aluminium elements joining disks and cylinder of 100 mm, and a reproducibility between different disks at the 10 mm level. The wheel is equipped with targets for measurements of the geometrical precision of the assembled structure. Photogrammetry, theodolites, and 3D coordinate measurement systems have been used for survey and alignment of the wheel structure. Some of these targets remain visible after
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||insertion of the TOB in the tracker support tube, for a precise measurement of the TOB positioning in the tracker reference frame, and even after integration of TIB, to monitor possible movements due to deformations of the loaded structure. The wheel mechanics has been thoroughly measured before starting rod integration, and the relative positioning of the precision elements has been found to be typically within 100 mm of nominal values over the whole TOB dimensions, with maximum deviations observed around 200 mm. The rod mechanics The rods are self-contained assemblies providing support and cooling for 6 or 12 silicon detector modules, together with their interconnection and read-out electronics. The mechanical structure consists of two 1130 mm long carbon ﬁber C-shaped proﬁles, joined by several transverse carbon ﬁber ribs and plates. All rod components are contained in an envelope of 159113022 mm3, except the four supporting spheres that stick out laterally in correspon- dence of the two disks of the wheel, and the z-stops that block the rod against the outer disk surface after insertion in the wheel. – 68 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004A U-shaped cooling pipe runs around the rod, inside the C-proﬁles; 24 aluminium inserts are glued through openings along the proﬁles to the carbon ﬁber and around the cooling pipe; these inserts provide support and cooling to the detector modules, that are mounted in six positions along the rod, three per side. Each detector is supported by four inserts, two close to the read-out hybrid, and two close to the sensor-to-sensor bonds. The two inserts close to the hybrid implement pins on which the Cu-Be springs on the module frame are clamped, determining the precision of the mod- ule positioning; all four inserts have a threaded hole for the ﬁxation of the module to the rod: cup-
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||shaped washers together with a calibrated torque used in tightening the screw ensure efﬁcient cool- ing contact between the aluminium heat spreader on the module frame and the rod support inserts. On the cooling pipe side, the shape and the size of the inserts is optimized to minimize the thermal impedance of the contact, which in turn allows to minimize the cross section of the cooling pipe. In single-sided rods, which populate layers 3–6, one detector module is mounted in each of the six positions, with the strips facing the central plane of the rod. In double-sided rods, which populate layers 1 and 2, two detectors are mounted in each position, the inner one as in single-sided rods and the outer one with the backplane facing the backplane of the ﬁrst module. The distance between the sensor and the middle plane of the rod is 3:3 mm in single-sided rods, 3:3 mm and 7:6 mm in double-sided rods. The rod cooling pipes, and the manifolds housed on the outer disks of the wheel, are realized in CuNi 70/30 alloy. This material is chosen for its corrosion resistance, and as it allows reliable solder joints to be made relatively easily, avoiding the use of o-rings or ferrules in the pipe connec- tions; the reliability of the cooling circuits is a crucial issue for the tracker, and particularly so for the TOB, which is the most inaccessible subsystem once the detector is fully integrated. The rather high density of the material (its radiation length of about 1.4 cm is 6 times shorter than that of alu- minium) is compensated by the reduced thickness of the walls that this technology allows: rod pipes and manifolds have 100 mm and 200 mm wall thickness, respectively. In addition the design of the cooling circuit has
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||been optimized (as already mentioned above), to minimize the cross section of the pipes (the cooling ﬂuid also gives a non-negligible contribution to the material budget), and to maximize the number of rod pipes served by a single manifold (within the constraints of the desired cooling performance). An outer diameter of 2.2 mm is chosen for single-sided rod pipes (providing cooling to 6 detectors), 2.5 mm for double-sided rod pipes (providing cooling to 12 detectors), and 6 mm for the manifolds; one manifold serves on average more than 15 rod pipes, the actual number varying between 8 and 22 depending on the region of the TOB. Overall, the whole TOB is served by 44 cooling lines, giving an average of 118 detectors, or 550 read-out chips, per line. Rod electrical design The 6 or 12 modules housed in a rod form a power group, i.e. they are supplied by a single power supply unit. The low voltage lines supplying the front-end hybrids and the Analogue Opto-Hybrids (AOHs) run in the Inter-Connect-Bus (ICB), a 700 mm long printed circuit board sitting in the middle plane of the rod (ﬁgure 3.27). The Communication and Control Unit Module (CCUM) is plugged to one end of the ICB. The clock and the control signals issued by the CCUM are also routed to the ﬁnal destinations through the ICB. The distribution of power, clock and sig- nals to front-end hybrids and AOHs proceeds through four other PCBs, the Inter-Connect-Cards – 69 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004 Figure 3.27: Photo of a rod frame equipped with electronics components, ready to receive silicon detector modules. (ICCs). Two ICCs serve one module position and two other ICCs serve two module positions. ICCs have different design in single-sided rods and double-sided rods, which have one and two modules mounted
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||in each module position, respectively; therefore there are in total four different ICC ﬂavours in the TOB. The ICB is held in place by small transverse carbon ﬁber plates; the ICCs and the CCUM are plugged to the ICB and screwed to the aluminium module support inserts (on the opposite side of the module), which also provide a good cooling contact to those boards. The AOHs are supported and cooled only by the connector that plugs to the ICCs. In addition to distributing LV power and CTRL signals, the ICCs receive the data lines from the read-out hybrid and route them to the AOHs (a few cm away) where they are converted to optical signals. The ICCs also receive lines carrying temperature information from the module frame Kapton circuit and route them to the ICB. The optical ﬁbers leaving the AOHs travel inside the carbon ﬁber proﬁles, guided by dedicated plastic holders. The only electrical lines not integrated in the ICB/ICCs distribution system are the bias lines for the sensors. These run in dedicated wires (size AWG 26) housed in the carbon ﬁber proﬁles, while the line with the return current is integrated in the ICB. There are six lines in single- sided rods (one per module), and 8 lines in double-sided rods (four serving one module each, and four serving two modules each). The LV lines and the HV lines go in separate connectors in the rod end-panel, each of which also hosts some temperature lines, and then run all together to the back- end in one multi-service cable plus low-impedance cable. At the power supply backplane the six or eight bias lines are connected to the two independent high-voltage supply lines in such a way that each line powers one side of the rod. The clock and control
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||lines as well as the LV lines powering the CCUM leave the rod through a short cable which plugs into the next rod of the control ring. The ﬁrst and the last rod of a control ring are connected to the Digital Opto-Hybrid Module (DOHM). This board houses the digital opto-hybrids optically connected to the remote control system and distributes the clock and the control signals through a token-ring 40 MHz LVDS-based protocol to the connected rods (up to 10). The length of the optical ﬁbers coming from the AOHs is chosen so that all ﬁbers end at the same location near the CCUM, where the connectors of the 12-ﬁber ribbons are integrated (ﬁgure 3.28). The choice of including the optical patch panel inside the rod volume was made to reduce the thickness of the TOB services on the TOB end-ﬂanges, so minimizing the inactive volume between TOB and TEC. – 70 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004 Figure 3.28: Top panel: photo of an assembled double-sided rod, showing the CCUM side, with the 12-way optical ribbons connected to the AOH ﬁbers. Bottom panel: double-sided rod being prepared for insertion in the TOB mechanics; the side opposite to the CCUM is shown. Electrical and read-out grouping The grouping of the rods into control rings is designed primarily to avoid having control rings spanning across two different cooling segments, while maximizing the size of a control ring (to reduce cost and material budget) within the recommended limit of 10 CCUMs per ring. This logic results in two or three control rings per cooling segment, with a single exception of a cooling segment containing one control ring only. The average number of CCUMs (i.e. of rods) per ring in the TOB is 7.5. Within a control ring, rods are clustered in groups that
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||are read out by the same FED. Again, a read-out group never spans over two control rings, and the grouping is optimized to minimize the number of unused channels in the FEDs (to reduce cost). The average FED occupancy in the TOB is 94%. In summary, the TOB is made of 688 rods read out by 134 FEDs, controlled by 92 DOHMs, and cooled by 44 independent lines. Grounding In each rod the return line of LV and bias is connected inside the CCUM to the return line of the LV power of DOHM and CCUMs, and connected through a short multi-wire cable to the cooling manifold serving the rod: this is the main ground connection of the rod. The grounding is improved by additional ground connections in each ICC, implemented through metalization around the mounting holes. The DOHMs, mounted on the TOB end-ﬂange (ﬁgure 3.29), are protected by alodyned alu- minium plates of 0.5 mm thickness, which are locally connected to the power return line. – 71 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004 Figure 3.29: Photo of the completed z+ side of the TOB. The DOHMs form the outer layer of the services on the TOB end ﬂange. Optical ribbons (green) run out, grouped in 16 channels. Power cables and feeding pipes run parallel to each other on the thermal screen panels. The cooling circuits of the different segments are then connected electrically through short multi-wire cables soldered to the radial pipes feeding the manifolds (or to the manifolds themselves, for the outer layer) and screwed to the ground rings: an alodyned aluminium bar of 10 10 mm2 square section bent to round shape and equipped all along with threaded holes, which is installed at the outer radius of the TOB, on both sides. Gold-coated copper strips of 30 mm
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||width and 0.2 mm thickness connect the ground ring to the carbon ﬁber structure of the outer cylinder, in eight locations in f. The connection to the carbon ﬁber is realized with conductive araldite. The same strip material is used to realize the electrical connections between outer cylinders and disks, and inner cylinders and disks, again in eight locations in f. In addition, copper strips as long as the whole TOB are added on the outer surface of the outer cylinder (visible in ﬁgure 3.26); for the inner cylinder instead, which is inside the tracking volume, it was decided to rely on the conductivity of the carbon ﬁber. Such design of the grounding scheme ensures good electrical connection of mechanical struc- tures and power return lines making efﬁcient use of the existing conductive materials (cooling pipes and carbon ﬁber parts), with minimal amount of added metallic elements. – 72 – 2008 JINST 3 S080043.3.6 Tracker EndCaps (TEC) Mechanical structure The endcaps extend radially from 220 mm to 1135 mm and from 1240 mm to2800 mm along thez-direction. The two endcaps are called TEC+ and TEC- (according to their location in zin the CMS coordinate system). Each endcap consists of nine disks that carry substructures on which the individual detector modules are mounted plus an additional two disks serving as front/back termi- nation. A sketch of one endcap and a photograph of the completed TEC+ is shown in ﬁgures 3.30 and3.31. Eight U-proﬁles, referred to as service channels because all services are grouped in their vicinity, join the disks together along their outer periphery, while at its inner diameter each disk is attached at four points to an inner support tube. To preserve the envelope necessary for the insertion of the pixel detector, the last six disks have a larger inner
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||radius (309 mm) as compared to the ﬁrst three (229 mm). The disks are Carbon Fiber Composite (CFC) / honeycomb structures. The honeycomb core is 16 mm thick NOMEX, 3.2-92 with a border of epoxy potting. On either side of the core there is a symmetric layup of CFC skins (0.4 mm thickness). The skin material is CF-fabric THENAX HTA 5131,3K (T300) impregnated with EP121 epoxy resin. The same material is used for the service channels and the inner support tube. The latter has a thickness of 3 mm and is azimuthally segmented into four 90segments. Each of these segments is attached to the disks and the gaps at the joints between segments are ﬁlled with epoxy glue so that they are gas tight. A thin cylindrical skin made of 0: 5 mm thick CFC panels surrounds the endcaps on the outside and serves as a gas envelope for the atmosphere of dry nitrogen. The front plate has the same function and consists of a 5 mm NOMEX core with 0: 2 mm CFC skins on each side. The back plate provides an additional thermal shielding for the cold silicon volume and is considerably thicker. The NOMEX core is 45 mm with each CFC skin 1: 5 mm thick. The back plate also serves to make the overall structure rigid in the z-direction. The back plate is covered by another carbon ﬁbre disk, the bulkhead, which is, however, mechanically detached from the TEC and supported by the tracker support tube. The bulkhead carries the outer connectors of all TEC cables, thereby forming a patch panel for the electrical connection of the TEC to the external power cables. It is covered by panels with heating foils which close the thermal screen at the end face of the tracker support tube. Ten

For reasons of mod- ularity they are mounted on substructures called petals, which in turn are mounted on the disks. Disks 1 to 3 carry seven rings of modules, ring 1 is missing on disks 4 to 6, rings 1 and 2 are miss- ing on disks 7 and 8, and disk 9 carries rings 4 to 7 only. Rings 1, 2 and 5 are built up of so-called double sided modules: two modules are mounted back-to-back with a stereo angle of 100 mrad. This provides space information perpendicular and parallel to the strip orientation. Petals To allow easy access to the detector modules they are mounted on modular elements, the petals (ﬁgures 3.32 and3.33). Petals can be individually removed from the endcaps without uncabling and/or disassembling the entire structure. A total of 16 petals are mounted on each of the nine disks of one endcap, eight on the front face of the disk — as seen from the interaction point — – 73 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004 Figure 3.30: Left panel: Sketch of one tracker endcap. Modules are arranged in rings around the beam axis. They are mounted on trapezoidal sub-structures called petals. One sector, indicated with a line, consists of nine front petals mounted on the disk sides facing the interaction point (3 FD13, 3 FD46, 2 FD78, 1 FD9) and nine back petals mounted in the opposite side of a disk (3 BD13, 3 BD46, 2 BD78, 1 BD9).

Mechanically there are two types each of front and
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||back petals, long petals for disks 1–3 and short ones for disks 4–9. As described above, the front and back petals on disks 1–3 carry all seven rings of modules and are labelled FD13 and BD13, respectively. Petals on disks 4–6 carry rings 2 to 7 (FD46/BD46), those on disks 7 and 8 carry rings 3 to 7 (FD78/BD78), and on disk 9 the petals carry rings 4 to 7 (FD9/BD9). The petals have a structure similar to the disks, consisting of a 10 mm NOMEX core sandwiched between – 74 – 2008 JINST 3 S080040:4 mm CFC skins. As viewed from the interaction point the modules belonging to rings 1, 3, 5, 7 are mounted on the petal front side (A-side and C-side for the front and back petals, respectively), while modules in rings 2, 4, 6 are mounted on the back side of each petal (B-side and D-side for the front and back petals, respectively). On a given disk the front petals overlap azimuthally with the back petals, as do, for a given petal, detector modules belonging to the same ring. Detectors in adjacent rings are arranged to overlap radially, thus providing full coverage. Each petal is mounted on inserts in the main disks using a three point ﬁxation: one point ﬁxed in x,yandz, one ﬁxed only in phi, and one ﬁxed only in z. Cooling The heat generated by all electronic components on a petal must be removed efﬁciently. In addition the silicon sensors must be operated at a temperature of about  10C to reduce the effects of radiation damage. The silicon sensors and front end hybrids are cooled via the CFC frames of the detector modules, for which carbon ﬁber of high thermal conductivity is used (800 W/(m K)). The aluminium inserts for positioning the modules
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||serve at the same time for the coupling to the cooling pipe. The two inserts along the legs of the module frame provide primarily for the cooling of the sensors, while the inserts on the frame base are heat sinks for the front end hybrid. Each petal contains two cooling circuits traversing the petal longitudinally and meandering from one cooling point to the next. The cooling pipes are made of titanium with an outer diameter of 3: 9 mm and a wall thickness of 0: 25 mm. They are embedded in the petal and serve to cool the components on both back and front side. The tubing is pre-bent into the proper shape. The input/output manifolds are laser welded onto the cooling pipes. After having milled the corresponding grooves and holes into the petals, the tubing is inserted. Gluing jigs are used to position the cooling inserts and to glue them to the pipes and to the petal. To close the grooves and re-establish the integrity of the petal a CFC skin with holes at the location of the inserts is glued onto the petal face. The inserts are then machined to the precision required for module positioning. The maximum heat load from the electronics on a petal is about 87 W, including the heating of the sensors after ten years of LHC operation. In these conditions a mass ﬂow of 2: 3 kg/min of the C 6F14coolant gives a temperature difference of 2C between petal inlet and outlet. The connection of the petal circuits to the piping running along zis done at the outer periphery of the petal. These connections can be undone easily in case the petal needs to be removed. A pair of longitudinal pipes serves either 4 or 5 petals, which are connected in parallel. A
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||total of 64 longitudinal stainless steel pipes with 11 mm inner diameter are used per endcap. Electrical system design The silicon modules, AOHs and CCUMs on the petals are connected to motherboards, called In- terConnect Boards or ICBs, which are mounted on both sides of the petal. In ﬁgure 3.32 photos of a bare front petal equipped with ICBs only are shown. There are ﬁve individual boards: the main board ICB  46 on side B/D, which carries all the connectors for the cables and two CCUM boards and transmits power and signals to the modules of rings 4 and 6, and four smaller boards, which provide the power and signals for the other rings (ICB  2 on side B/D and ICB  1, ICB 3 and ICB 57 on side A/C, where the numbers correspond to the number of the ring to which the – 75 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004 Figure 3.32: The different ICBs on the two sides of a front petal: ICB  2 and ICB 46 on side B, and ICB 1, ICB 3 and ICB 57 on side A (from left to right). On ICB  46, the two CCUMs are plugged. Figure 3.33: Left photograph: front side of a TEC Petal. Right photograph: back side. connected modules belong). These four boards are connected to the main board. The ICB brings the ground, the various supply voltages and the bias voltage to the electrical devices on the petal, and transmits LVDS and I2C signals. In addition analogue data from the FE hybrids are transmitted differentially to the AOHs over distances of a few centimetres. To keep the number of low voltage power supplies and connections relatively small while limiting the current that must be provided by one power supply, the modules are organized in three low voltage (LV) groups, which are served by individual
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||power supplies. The LV group 1 consists of rings 1 and 2, group 2 contains rings 3, 4 and 6 and ﬁnally rings 5 and 7 belong to group 3. This corresponds to 8/11/9 (4/8/11) modules or 48/44/44 (24/32/56) APVs on front (back) petals in LV group 1/2/3. In total there are eleven power rails on ICB  46, which must carry a current of up to 12 A. Sensing is implemented for the low voltage connections. The sense resistors are located in the electrical centre of each power group. Capacitances are implemented on the ICB near the power input connectors as well as near the front-end connectors to suppress ripples and minimize a possible voltage overshoot caused by switching off the FE-hybrids. For each low voltage group, two high voltage channels are provided. For each HV channel there are up to four single HV lines, which bias one or two silicon modules. The ICB 46 and ICB 57 have six copper layers, while the smaller boards have only four layers. To limit the contribution to the material budget, the copper layers are rather narrow and thin. – 76 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004The layer thickness amounts to 17 and 25 mm for the inner four and outer two layers, respectively, except for the innermost layer of boards ICB  1, ICB 3 and ICB 57 on front petals and ICB  1, ICB 2 and ICB 3 on back petals, which has a thickness of 35 mm. Digital and data traces are shielded by power and ground layers. Two petals, one back and one front petal, are connected in a control ring. The front petal is the ﬁrst in the control loop. Both on back and front petals, rings 1–4 and 5–7 are connected to one CCU, respectively. The Digital Opto-Hybrid (DOH) converts the optical signals to electrical
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||LVDS signals and vice versa. Two DOHs are located on a separate PCB, the Digital Opto-Hybrid Module (DOHM), which is mounted on the back petal. From the DOHM, which also distributes the power for the DOHs, electrical signals are transmitted to the CCUMs on the petal. For the control ring, a redundancy scheme is implemented on the ICB. Each CCU can be bypassed electrically in case of a problem, so that the functionality of the control ring is maintained. The second DOH is needed for redundancy purposes only. To allow also the last CCU on the ring to be bypassed, a ﬁfth CCU is located on the DOHM. It is used only in this special case. However, if two consecutive CCUs are faulty, the complete control ring is lost. Low-pass ﬁlters are implemented for the traces of the temperature signals that are brought out via power cables, to ensure that noise is not coupled in via these lines. In addition to the thermistors located on the Kapton of the silicon modules, several temperature and humidity probes are located on or connected to the ICB. Two 10 kW NTC thermistors are located on ICB_46 on front petals and read out via the power cable of low voltage group 2. Both on front and back petals, four 10 kW NTC thermistors are glued to the cooling inserts of the ring 6 modules. They are read out via the DCU that is present on each CCUM. On both petal types, a humidity sensor can be connected to ICB_46. For back petals, this sensor is read out via the power cable of LV group 2. On each z- side in total 12 hardwired humidity sensors are distributed over the TEC volume. For front petals, the humidity sensor is read out via the DCU on
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||the CCUM. Front petals of all disks of the top and bottom sectors carry these additional humidity sensors, providing detailed information on the relative humidity along the z-direction. Kapton cables of about 15 cm length are used to link the petals inside one control ring with each other and with the DOHM, providing the electrical digital signals and the power for the CCUMs. These cables consist of two copper layers with a thickness of 35 mm each, separated by a 100 mm thick polyimide layer. Each TEC LV group is supplied by one so-called multiservice cable, which transmits the analogue power and the bias voltage and brings out signals from temperature or humidity sensors. Inside the tracker support tube, power cables are arranged around the main TEC cooling pipes that run along the zdirection, and end at the bulkhead. These cables implement silver-plated aluminium conductors to minimize the impact on the material budget. Typical currents per cable range from about 5 A to 11 A, depending on the number of APVs connected. Therefore three cable types exist, with wire cross-sections tailored to the differing needs. The connection from the bulkhead to the so-called patch panel 1, located outside of the tracker volume, is provided by power cables implementing tinned copper conductors. The control power is transmitted via separate cables, which also break at the bulkhead. In this case tinned copper conductors are used both inside and outside the tracker volume. – 77 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004The grounding scheme The so-called TEC common ground is located at the back end of each TEC. It is realized by means of a 5 cm wide and 150 mm thick copper ring, which is glued to the outer radius of each back disk and tied to the brackets that connect the tracker support
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||tube to the hadron calorimeter. The material of the hadron calorimeter represents a very solid ground. The shields of all cables, the reference points of all power groups, the cooling manifolds that are used to connect the cooling pipes of the petals to the main tubes that are mounted on the TEC, the CF skins of the disks and petals and the outer aluminium shields of the TEC are connected to this TEC common ground. On the petal side, one common analogue ground is implemented per petal. This so-called local petal ground is distributed via a 2 cm wide and 20 mm thick copper path along the ICBs as a reference rail. The LV and HV supplies of all power groups are referenced to this local petal ground at the geometrical/electrical centre of each group. The digital ground of a control group is referenced once to the local petal ground. The local petal ground of each petal is connected to the TEC common ground. Copper strips glued to the outer radii of the disks and along the service channels that connect all disks with the back disk provide the electrical connection to the TEC common ground. These copper strips are connected via short copper braids to the ICBs on the petals. The carbon frames of the silicon detectors are connected via a conductive glue spot to the bias Kapton and ﬁnally via the ICB to the FE hybrid ground. To avoid ground loops, the frames are electrically insulated from the cooling pipes by an anodized layer between the cooling inserts and the pipe. 3.3.7 Geometry and alignment The deviation of true position and orientation of tracker modules from their nominal values as speciﬁed in the engineering drawings depends on many factors with different origin, some of them time-dependent: the achieved
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||assembly precision, deformation due to tracker cooling, stress from access and magnetic ﬁeld, out-gassing of components in dry nitrogen. This leads to a degradation of the track parameter resolution (ﬁgure 3.4), which needs to be recovered by determining true module position and orientation, called alignment. Alignment of the tracker relies on three key components: the various data about assembly gathered during the integration process, the Laser Alignment System and the alignment with tracks, ordered by increasing precision and availability with time. For alignment purposes, modules with two sensors are treated as they would have one large sensor with identical active area coverage. This is justiﬁed by sensor mask design [36] and achieved sensor placement accuracy (ﬁgure 3.23). The CMS tracker alignment task thus consists of the determination of three translational and three rotational parameters for each of the 15 148 tracker modules. To achieve ultimate precision, it might be necessary to consider additional parameters, e.g. the sensor bow due to single-sided processing. Geometry Two methods are mainly used for measuring tracker component assembly precision: survey with coordinate measurement machines with a typical accuracy of a few mm to a few tens of mm, and – 78 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004Table 3.2: Estimated assembly precision (RMS, in mm) of tracker components.

The software description of the position and orientation of the active detector volumes has been validated with survey data and reconstructed tracks from test beams and cosmic muons recorded in various test and integration setups. Laser Alignment System The Laser Alignment System (LAS, ﬁgure 3.34) uses infrared laser beams with a wavelength l=1075 nm to monitor the position of selected tracker modules. It operates globally on tracker substructures (TIB, TOB and TEC discs) and cannot determine the position of individual modules. The goal of the system is to generate alignment information on a continuous basis, providing ge- ometry reconstruction of the tracker substructures at the level of 100 mm, which is mandatory for track pattern recognition and for the High Level Trigger. In addition, possible tracker structure movements can be monitored at the level of 10 mm, providing additional input for the track based alignment. In each TEC, laser beams cross all nine TEC discs in ring 6 (ray 2) and ring 4 (ray 3) on back petals, equally distributed in f. Here special silicon sensors with a 10 mm hole in the backside metalization and an anti-reﬂective coating are mounted. The beams are used for the internal align- ment of the TEC discs. The other eight beams (ray 4), distributed in f, are foreseen to align TIB, TOB, and both TECs with respect to each other. Finally, there is a link to the Muon system (ray 1), which is established by 12 laser beams (six on each side) with precise position and orientation in the tracker coordinate system. The signal induced by the laser beams in the silicon sensors decreases in height as the beams penetrate through

To obtain optimal signals on all sensors, a sequence of laser pulses with increasing intensities, optimized for each position, is generated. Several triggers per intensity are taken and the signals are averaged. In total, a few hundred triggers are needed to get a full picture of the alignment of the tracker structure. Since the trigger rate for the alignment system is around 100 Hz, this will take only a few seconds. These data will be taken at regular intervals, both in dedicated runs and during physics data taking. Alignment with tracks CMS pursues the development of two novel track-based alignment algorithms that allow to quickly solve the system of linear equations of order O(100 000). The ﬁrst is an extension to the well- known global Millepede algorithm [52], that takes all correlations into account and has been shown to successfully align the most sensitive 50 000 parameters. The second is a novel approach using a Kalman Filter [53], which bridges the gap between global and local algorithms by taking into account the most important correlations. In addition the HIP [54] algorithm, which is local in the sense that it takes into account only correlations of parameters within a module, is developed in parallel. In this algorithm, correlations between modules are dealt with implicitly by iterating the alignment many times. All three methods are expected to be able to provide alignment constants for the full silicon pixel and strip tracker. Experience from other experiments has shown that collision data are not sufﬁcient to constrain certain correlated module movements well enough
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||to obtain a unique set of alignment constants. Therefore complementary data and constraints need to be exploited. Examples are tracks from cosmic muons (with and without magnetic ﬁeld) that constrain the tracker barrel modules, or beam halo muons for the endcap. Beam gas and minimum bias events are also under consideration. Typical examples of constraints are a vertex constraint for decay particles e.g. from Z!m+m  or jets, mass constraints, measurements from the Laser Alignment System, and survey constraints. First studies indicate that those data will provide a unique alignment parameter set. – 80 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004 disk number123456789 [mrad]φΔ -0.2-0.15-0.1-0.05-00.050.10.150.2 disk number123456789x [mm]Δ -0.3-0.2-0.100.10.20.3 disk number123456789y [mm]Δ -0.3-0.2-0.100.10.20.3 LAS Survey CosmicsFigure 3.35: TEC+ disk rotation Df(around the beam axis) and displacements Dx;Dy(in the disk plane) as determined from survey, LAS and cosmic muon tracks. During integration of the TEC+, deviation of disk positions and rotations from nominal val- ues have been determined from survey with photogrammetry, the LAS, and tracks from cosmic muons. Figure 3.35 shows the results from the three complementary methods. The global degrees of freedom (absolute position and orientation, torsion and shear around the symmetry axis) have been ﬁxed by requiring the average displacement and rotation as well as torsion and shear to be zero. The values agree within 60 mm and 80 mrad with each other, which can be taken as an upper value on the precision of each method. 3.3.8 Detector control and safety system The Tracker Detector Safety System (TDSS) and tracker Detector Control System (tracker DCS) is a two pillar system. The TDSS ensures independently the safety, with a large PLC (Programmable Logical Controller) system, occupying 6 LHC racks. A limited set of around 1000 hardwired temperature and humidity sensors are evaluated and out of limit states interlock power supplies. The
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||tracker DCS, as a complementary partner, controls, monitors and archives all important parameters. The heart of the DCS is composed out of an industrial SCADA program (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition) PVSS (Prozessvisualisierungs- und Steuerungssystem from ETM Austria, chapter 9) together with a Finite State Machine written in SMI++, a derivative of the former DELPHI control software; thus using the standard control software framework for all LHC experiments. The main task of the DCS is to control about 2000 power supplies for silicon module low and high voltage power and about 100 low voltage control power supplies via the OPC (OLE for Process Automation) protocol. Detector interdependencies of control, low and high voltages are handled, as well as fast ramp downs in case of higher than allowed temperatures or currents in the detector, experimental cavern problems, etc. All this is ensured by evaluating 104power supply parameters, 103data points from DSS via a Siemens S7 driver and 105readings from the DCUs situated on all front end hybrids and control units CCUs. Several passive alarms and warning levels are deﬁned for temperature, relative humidity, voltages, currents, etc. and are reported in a global warning panel as well as limits that, if surpassed, would result in automatic shutdown. Information from the tracker cooling plant, the thermal screen, beam conditions and the dry gas system are crucial for safe running and are accessible from the tracker DCS and TDSS. – 81 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004All parameters are archived to ORACLE. The TDSS (tracker DCS) system is fully implemented in the global CMS DSS (DCS) and Run Control system. 3.3.9 Operating experience and test results Performance in test beam experiments The system performance of integrated structures of the silicon strip tracker and its data acquisition chain as well as the performance of the silicon
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||strip modules themselves has been studied in various test beam experiments at CERN and the Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI), Villigen (CH). In test beam campaigns, performed in May and October 2004 at the X5 test beam complex in the CERN west area, large substructures of TIB, TOB and TEC were exposed to a secondary pion beam with an energy of 120 GeV and a tertiary muon beam with muon energies ranging from 70 to 120 GeV . The TIB setup comprised a prototype half-shell structure of layer 3, equipped with eight single- sided strings, plus four double-sided strings, mounted on a custom support structure. For the TOB, the so-called cosmic rack, a precise mechanical telescope-like structure equipped with four single- sided and two double-sided rods, was used in the beam tests. The TEC setup consisted of one back and one front petal [55]. These setups corresponded to about 1% of the complete TIB, TOB and TEC detectors, respectively. The TOB and TEC setups were operated at a temperature below  10°C, while the TIB setup was operated at room temperature. Typical primary trigger rates for the pion beam were 600 000 pions per spill (a 2.2 s long period within a 12 s long SPS cycle during which particles are delivered) corresponding to a mean occupancy of 15 Hz/cm2. In the strip-cluster ﬁnding the cuts for the signal-to-noise ratio, S/N, of the cluster seed / neighbour strips / total cluster are 4/3/5 for TIB, 5/2/5 for TOB and 3/2/5 for TEC, respectively. The cluster noise is calculated by adding the single strip noise values in quadrature (TIB, TEC) or by taking the seed noise as the cluster noise (TOB). To determine the most probable value for the S/N of a module, a Landau distribution convoluted with a Gaussian is ﬁtted to
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||the signal-to-noise distribution, and the most probable value of the ﬁtted function is quoted as the S/N. The mean most probable S/N values for all module types, together with their strip length, pitch and abbreviations used in the following, are summarized in table 3.3. For thin (thick) TEC sensors, most probable S/N values of 29–33 (36–42) in peak mode and 19–22 (20–24) in deconvo- lution mode have been observed [55]. For the thick TOB OB1 (OB2) modules a S/N of typically 36 (38) and 25 (27) was found in peak and deconvolution mode, respectively [17], while the thin TIB IB1 (IB2) modules exhibited a S/N of 26 (30) in peak mode and 18 (20) in deconvolution mode. Assuming that a MIP creates 24 000 electrons in a 300 mm thick layer of silicon [16], and assuming that the beam particles can be treated as MIPs, the S/N can be used to calculate the equivalent noise charge, ENC. The common mode subtracted noise depends on the capacitance of the sensor, which depends linearly on the strip length and the ratio between strip width and pitch, w=p[16]. Since w=p=0:25 for all sensor types, the ENC varies between different module types according to the strip length. Results for all module types except W1TID are summarized in table 3.3. Measurements performed at low temperature (for the TEC, typically hybrid temperatures of+10°C and 0°C were reached for hybrids with six and four APVs, respectively) are plotted versus the strip length in ﬁgure 3.36. A linear ﬁt to these data yields the following dependence of – 82 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004the ENC on the strip length L: ENC peak = ( 36:61:9)e =cmL+ (40527)e ; ENC dec = ( 49:93:2)e =cmL+ (59047)e : The common mode noise is the standard deviation of the common mode, calculated per APV from
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||a certain number of events. The mean common mode noise has been evaluated and amounts to (17338)and(29976)electrons for TEC (mean from all APVs in the setup) and (265 36) and (30019)electrons for TIB (mean from all APVs of TIB2 modules) in peak and deconvolution mode, respectively. Although no dedicated beam telescope was available, efﬁciency studies have been performed both with the TOB and TEC setups, exploiting the fact that in both cases the beam penetrated several layers of modules. Efﬁciencies of above 99% have been observed in all such studies. The uniformity of the module performance along and perpendicular to the strip direction has been studied in 2003 with several TIB modules in a test beam experiment at the X5 complex. Two single-sided strings equipped with IB2 modules were mounted on a structure corresponding to a portion of a layer 3 half-shell, and operated at room temperature. To study the uniformity across the strips, the strips read out by three APVs (on two different modules) were exposed to a pion beam, and between 1000 and 8000 events were collected per strip. A cluster was associated to a strip if the centre of gravity xof the cluster was reconstructed within (n 0:5)p<x<(n+0:5)pfor strip n and pitch p. The uniformity, deﬁned as the ratio between the RMS and the mean of the respective distribution, was 1.3% for the cluster noise, with an increase close to the APV chip edges. The cluster charge uniformity was of the order of 1.4%, but dropped to 0.5% if calculated separately for groups of 32 adjacent strips. A uniformity of the S/N of 1.6% on average and of 1.0% for groups of 32 strips was measured. To investigate the uniformity along the strips, a muon beam was used for its uniform particle density. The cluster position along the
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||strip could be obtained from the TOB setup that was operated in the same test beam, since the strip direction of the TOB modules was perpendicular to that of the TIB modules. The clusters were binned in 24 intervals according to their centre of gravity, corresponding to length intervals of 5 mm, and about 1500 events were accumulated per bin. Both the uniformity of cluster charge and S/N were found to be 1.4%. Performance during integration Testing during integration consisted typically of checks of the control ring functionality, tests of the I2C communication of all chips, tests of the gain of the optical connections, commissioning (i.e. tuning of chip operation parameters), pedestal runs in peak and deconvolution mode, bias voltage ramping up to 450 V , read-out of currents and module and hybrid temperatures through the DCUs, and a functionality check of the temperature and humidity sensors. In the following sections the performance of TEC, TIB/TID and TOB during integration is described. Two comments apply to all three sub-detectors: • Numbers of dead and noisy strips are given below. While dead strips can be identiﬁed reli- ably, the noisiness of strips depends on external conditions such as grounding and the APV read-out mode and the ﬁgures given should be regarded as estimates only.

These edge strips are included in the numbers of ﬂagged strips, although they are usually fully efﬁcient. • Although all components (petals, rods, single modules in case of the TIB/TID) were tested before insertion and components not fulﬁlling strict quality
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||criteria were rejected, several defects have been observed during integration. Typical defects are broken optical ﬁbers, bad APVs (i.e. with many noisy or dead strips), and missing or unreliable I2C communication – 84 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004of complete modules or single chips. Most of the problems are assumed to be caused by mishandling during insertion or cabling. Since the exchange of components bears a consid- erable risk, not all defective components have been exchanged. Additional defects could be introduced by any following handling step, such as cabling of the tracker. The numbers given below should thus be regarded as a snapshot reﬂecting the situation right after integration of the single sub-detectors. TEC Performance during integration The TEC petals were integrated sector-wise, where one sector corresponds to one eighth of a TEC inf, and comprises 18 petals that share nine control rings and four cooling circuits. After integra- tion of one sector, a read-out test of the full sector was performed at room temperature, with the coolant at +15°C and mean silicon and hybrid temperatures of about +23°C and +33°C, respec- tively. During integration a ﬂaw in the crimping of the connectors of the multiservice power cables was found. After all such connectors had been replaced on both TECs, the system performance observed during integration was very robust. In ﬁgure 3.37, left side, the common mode subtracted noise of all strips of both TECs is shown for deconvolution mode. Since the measured noise depends on the gain of the optical chain, the noise was normalized to the digital output of the APV (scale on upper x-axis in ﬁgure 3.37). In addition, the number of ADC counts in the FED was converted to ENC according to the following method: with a nominal digital APV output of 4 mA and a nominal
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||APV gain of 1 MIP/mA for thin sensors, the height of the digital output corresponds to 8 MIPs or 200 000 electrons. This method allows a direct comparison of the measurements from different optical channels and delivers an approximate absolute calibration of the equivalent noise charge. Cross-checks with cosmic muon data performed during TIB/TID integration indicate that this scaling agrees with the real ENC within 10–20%. Furthermore, the noise depends on the strip capacitance and thus on the strip length, i.e. on the module type. For this reason the noise of all strips was normalized to the strip length of modules of ring 1 (8.52 cm). In addition a correction was applied to TEC- data to account for the fact that they were taken with other chip parameter settings than TEC+ data. The common mode subtraction was performed assuming a constant common mode per APV . To extract the mean noise, a gaussian was ﬁtted to the distribution. The resulting mean common mode subtracted noise amounts to 1693 75 electrons in this normalization. The mean common mode noise, calculated per APV , amounts to (22 4)% and (213)% of the mean intrinsic noise in peak and deconvolution mode, respectively (ﬁgure 3.38, left, for all non-defective APVs of TEC+). The ﬂatness of the noise across the APV is a good indicator for the quality of the grounding. The relative spread of the total noise (before common mode subtraction), i.e. the RMS of the noise divided by the mean noise, both calculated per APV , can be used to quantify the ﬂatness. The relative spread is (2: 50:2)% in both read-out modes, as shown in ﬁgure 3.38, right, indicating that the grounding scheme implemented by the TEC works well. Strips are counted as noisy or dead if their noise is more than

The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||AOHs were assembled onto half layers and disks and tested extensively for functionality, including pedestals, once a mother cable was completed (corresponding to a string in the TIB and three single-sided or ﬁve double-sided modules in the TID). Completed disks and half layers were then subjected to a burn-in in a climatic chamber, during which the structures were operated at a silicon sensor temperature of about  15°C. The complete half layers and disks were read out during these tests. Typically, the structures underwent 2–3 cooling cycles during a ﬁve day measurement period. After-wards disks and half layers were assembled into the complete TIB/TID+ and TIB/TID- structures and shipped to CERN, where the last integration operations were performed, such as connection of ﬁbers to the ﬁnal ribbons and cabling of the margherita. – 86 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004After optimization of the grounding scheme, the noise performance observed in the TIB and TID structures was very good. For the TIB and TID structures the scaled common mode subtracted noise of all strips, except for two TIB half-shells for which data were taken under non-ﬁnal running conditions and three half-shells for which the proper grounding scheme was not yet implemented, is shown in ﬁgure 3.39 for deconvolution mode. Scaling and common mode subtraction have been implemented as previously described in this section. These data have been taken under nominal CMS conditions, with a mean silicon sensor temperature of about  15°C, hybrid temperatures ranging from 4°C (TID double-sided modules) to  14°C (TIB single-sided modules) and APV parameters set as intended for this temperature range. The mean noise, taken from a gaussian ﬁt, amounts to (123387)electrons in the TIB and (124676) electrons in the TID. Measure- ments with a silicon sensor temperature of about +10°C and hybrid temperatures of +10C to +30°C show a mean
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||noise about 20% larger. In contrast to the TEC, a strip is ﬂagged as dead if its noise is below 75% of the average noise of the APV , and APV edge strips are not treated differently. The total number of bad channels is 4.4 per mille in TIB/TID+ and 3.4 per mille in TIB/TID-. TOB performance during integration Fully equipped and tested rods were integrated cooling segment-wise. After a ﬁrst functional test, the cooling connection was soldered and a leak test was performed. Then the cooling segment was cabled, and a full read-out test, including pedestals, was performed at room temperature. During these measurements, the silicon sensor temperature was about +24°C and the hybrid temperature about +30°C. During integration, a sensitivity to pick-up noise has been observed, which leads to non-ﬂat, wing-like common mode subtracted noise distributions. This sensitivity is especially pronounced for layers 3 and 4, which are equipped with single-sided 4 APV modules, and within these layers the effect is worst for modules mounted closest to the CCUM. Deﬁning as a ﬁgure of merit the ratio of the highest noise amplitude (taken from a parabola ﬁt to the noise distribution) to the ﬂat noise baseline, and counting all APVs with a ratio above 1.25 as “in the wings”, the fraction of APVs in the wings is about 30% in layers 3 and 4 and about 7% and 1% in layers 1/2 and 5/6, respectively. In total, 11.4% of all APVs are found to be in the wings according to this criterion. It has been veriﬁed that either with adjusted cluster cuts or with a linear online common mode subtraction the increase in the cluster width and occupancy is negligible. The normalized noise of all TOB strips is shown in ﬁgure 3.37, right. The tail to high noise
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||values comes from the non-ﬂat noise distributions. The mean noise from a gaussian ﬁt amounts to (2049112) electrons. Due to this wing-like noise structure, a special algorithm has been adopted to evaluate the number of dead and noisy strips. A parabola is ﬁtted to the noise distribution of each APV in an iterative procedure, and strips are ﬂagged as bad if their noise deviates more than ten times the RMS of the distribution of ﬁt residuals from the ﬁtted function. Only very few permanent defects, corresponding to 0.6 per mille of lost channels, have been introduced during TOB integration. Including the number of noisy and dead strips, the number of bad channels amounts to 0.6 per mille in TOB+ and 1.9 per mille in TOB-. – 87 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004 Figur e 3.39: Normalized common mode subtracted single strip noise for TIB (left panel) and TID (right panel), in deconvolution mode. Details are described in the text. Irradiation studies As already discussed in detail in section 3.1.1, the silicon strip tracker will suffer from a severe level of radiation during its 10 year long lifetime: up to 1 :81014neqcm 2for TIB/TID and TEC and up to 0: 51014neqcm 2for TOB, assuming an integrated luminosity of 500 fb 1. The radial andzdependence of the ﬂuence both for fast hadrons and neutrons is described in detail in [15, 16]. Hadrons are expected to dominate in the inner part of the tracker, up to a radius of about 0.5 m, while neutrons backscattered off the electromagnetic calorimeter dominate further outside. Safety factors of 1.5 and 2.0 on the ﬂuence are typically applied for TIB/TID and TOB/TEC, respectively. To ensure that both the FE electronics and the silicon sensors can be operated safely and with satisfactory performance after such an irradiation, several irradiation tests with
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||neutrons and protons have been carried out. Neutron irradiation was usually performed at the isochronous cy- clotron of the Centre de Recherches du Cyclotron, Louvain-la-Neuve, which delivers neutrons with a mean energy of 20 MeV (hardness factor 1.95 relative to 1 MeV neutrons [58]). Proton irradiation has been carried out e.g. at the compact cyclotron of the Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe, where a 26 MeV proton beam (hardness factor 1.85 relative to 1 MeV neutrons) with a current of 100 mA and a beam spot diameter of 1 cm is available. To study the performance of complete irradiated modules, several OB1 and OB2 modules (table 3.3for explanation) were irradiated with a proton ﬂuence ranging from 0: 11014neqcm 2 to 0: 71014neqcm 2, and one OB2 module was subjected to a neutron ﬂuence of about 1:21014neqcm 2[57]. Two TEC W5 modules were irradiated with a proton ﬂuence of about 1: 11014neqcm 2, and three TIB IB1 modules were subjected to a proton ﬂuence of 0:51014neqcm 2to 2:11014neqcm 2. The effect of annealing was simulated by heating the modules for 80 minutes at 60°C and afterwards storing them at room temperature for at least two hours. To prevent uncontrolled annealing, the modules were stored at  20°C between the irradia- tion or annealing steps. Measurements were performed at  15°C. As expected from inversion from n- to p-type doping, the full depletion voltage increased with the ﬂuence, as shown in ﬁgure 3.40 (left). However, the required depletion voltage stays below 500 V , which is the maximum depletion voltage for which the sensors are speciﬁed. The dependence of the depletion voltage on annealing time was studied as well and found to be in – 88 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004 ]2/cmeq n14Fluence [100 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5Depletion voltage [V] 0100200300400500600 ]2/cmeqn14Fluence [100 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4]3Current density [mA/cm

The leakage current is expected to increase with ﬂuence, leading to a larger heat dissipation and increased noise. In ﬁgure 3.40 (right) the dependence of the current density on the ﬂuence is shown. The current related damage rate, deﬁned as the current increase, scaled to 20°C, per sensor volume and equivalent neutron ﬂuence, amounts to (3:790:27)10 17A/cm, which is in good agreement with literature and measurements from test structures. Measurements of the signal-to-noise ratio, S/N, of irradiated modules have been performed with a90Sr source. Due to an increase of the noise and a decrease of the charge collection efﬁciency, the S/N is expected to decrease with ﬂuence. The dependence of the S/N on the accumulated ﬂuence for thick and thin sensors in both
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||read-out modes is shown in ﬁgure 3.41. For thick sensors, the S/N decreased from 23 (35) to 15 (21) in deconvolution (peak) mode, while for thin sensors a decrease from 18 (24) to 13 (18) was observed. These ﬁgures ensure a hit ﬁnding efﬁciency of above 95% even after 10 years of operation at the LHC [60, 61]. – 89 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004Chapter 4 Electromagnetic calorimeter The electromagnetic calorimeter of CMS (ECAL) is a hermetic homogeneous calorimeter made of 61200 lead tungstate (PbWO 4) crystals mounted in the central barrel part, closed by 7324 crys- tals in each of the two endcaps. A preshower detector is placed in front of the endcap crystals. Avalanche photodiodes (APDs) are used as photodetectors in the barrel and vacuum phototriodes (VPTs) in the endcaps. The use of high density crystals has allowed the design of a calorimeter which is fast, has ﬁne granularity and is radiation resistant, all important characteristics in the LHC environment. One of the driving criteria in the design was the capability to detect the decay to two photons of the postulated Higgs boson. This capability is enhanced by the good energy resolution provided by a homogeneous crystal calorimeter. 4.1 Lead tungstate crystals The characteristics [62] of the PbWO 4crystals make them an appropriate choice for operation at LHC. The high density (8.28 g/cm3), short radiation length (0.89 cm) and small Molière radius (2.2 cm) result in a ﬁne granularity and a compact calorimeter. In recent years, PbWO 4scintil- lation properties and other qualities have been progressively improved, leading to the mass pro- duction of optically clear, fast and radiation-hard crystals [63, 64]. The scintillation decay time of these production crystals is of the same order of magnitude as the LHC bunch crossing time: about 80% of the light
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||is emitted in 25 ns. The light output is relatively low and varies with tem- perature (  2:1%C 1at 18°C [65]): at 18°C about 4.5 photoelectrons per MeV are collected in both APDs and VPTs. The crystals emit blue-green scintillation light with a broad maximum at 420–430 nm [64, 66]. Longitudinal optical transmission and radioluminescence spectra are shown in ﬁgure 4.1. To exploit the total internal reﬂection for optimum light collection on the photodetector, the crystals are polished after machining. For fully polished crystals, the truncated pyramidal shape makes the light collection non-uniform along the crystal length. The effect is large because of the high refractive index (n =2:29 around the peak wavelength [67]) and the needed uniformity [68] is achieved by depolishing one lateral face. In the endcaps, the light collection is naturally more uniform because the crystal faces are nearly parallel. Pictures of barrel and endcap crystals with the photodetectors attached are shown in ﬁgure 4.2. – 90 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004 Figure 4.1: Longitudinal optical transmission (1, left scale) and radioluminescence intensity (2, right scale) for production PbWO 4crystals. Figur e 4.2: PbWO 4crystals with photodetectors attached. Left panel: A barrel crystal with the upper face depolished and the APD capsule. In the insert, a capsule with the two APDs. Right panel: An endcap crystal and VPT. The crystals have to withstand the radiation levels and particle ﬂuxes [69] anticipated through- out the duration of the experiment. Ionizing radiation produces absorption bands through the formation of colour centres due to oxygen vacancies and impurities in the lattice. The practical consequence is a wavelength-dependent loss of light transmission without changes to the scintil- lation mechanism, a damage which can be tracked and corrected for by monitoring the optical transparency with injected laser light (section 4.9). The damage reaches
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||a dose-rate dependent equilibrium level which results from a balance between damage and recovery at 18°C [64, 70]. – 91 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004To ensure an adequate performance throughout LHC operation, the crystals are required to exhibit radiation hardness properties quantiﬁed as an induced light attenuation length (at high dose rate) greater than approximately 3 times the crystal length even when the damage is saturated. Hadrons have been measured to induce a speciﬁc, cumulative reduction of light transmission, but the ex- trapolation to LHC conditions indicates that the damage will remain within the limits required for good ECAL performance [71, 72]. 4.2 The ECAL layout and mechanics The barrel part of the ECAL (EB) covers the pseudorapidity range jhj<1:479. The barrel gran- ularity is 360-fold in fand (2 85)-fold in h, resulting in a total of 61200 crystals. The crystals have a tapered shape, slightly varying with position in h. They are mounted in a quasi-projective geometry to avoid cracks aligned with particle trajectories, so that their axes make a small angle (3o) with respect to the vector from the nominal interaction vertex, in both the fandhprojec- tions. The crystal cross-section corresponds to approximately 0.0174 0.0174 in h-for 22 22 mm2at the front face of crystal, and 26 26 mm2at the rear face. The crystal length is 230 mm corresponding to 25.8 X 0. The barrel crystal volume is 8.14 m3and the weight is 67.4 t. The centres of the front faces of the crystals are at a radius 1.29 m. The crystals are contained in a thin-walled alveolar structure (submodule). The alveolar wall is 0.1 mm thick and is made of an aluminium layer, facing the crystal, and two layers of glass ﬁbre-epoxy resin. To avoid oxidation, a special coating is applied to the aluminium surface. The nominal
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||crystal to crystal distance is 0.35 mm inside a submodule, and 0.5 mm between submodules. To reduce the number of different types of crystals, each submodule contains only a pair of shapes, left and right reﬂections of a single shape. In total, there are 17 such pairs of shapes. The submodules are assembled into modules of different types, according to the position in h, each containing 400 or 500 crystals. Four modules, separated by aluminium conical webs 4-mm thick, are assembled in a supermodule, which contains 1700 crystals (ﬁgures 4.3and4.4). In each module, the submodules are held in partial cantilever by an aluminium grid, which supports their weight from the rear. At the front the submodule free ends are connected together by pincers that cancel the relative tangential displacements. The submodule cantilever is reduced by the action of a 4-mm thick cylindrical plate where the front of the submodules are supported by setpins. Not all the submodules are connected to the cylindrical plate but only four rows in f from a total of ten. The portion of the submodule load taken at the front by the cylindrical plate is transmitted to the aluminium grids of the different modules via the conical webs interspaced between the modules [73]. Each module is supported and positioned in the supermodule at the rear end through the grid by a spine beam. The spine is provided with pads which slide into rails housed on the front face of the HCAL barrel, allowing the installation and support of each single supermodule. The cylindrical plate in front of the supermodule also provides the ﬁxation of the monitoring system (see below) and the holes for its optical ﬁbres. All services, cooling manifolds and cables converge to a patch panel at the external end of the supermodule. Eighteen supermodules,

The endcap consists of identically shaped crystals grouped in mechanical units of 5 5 crystals (supercrystals, or SCs) consisting of a carbon-ﬁbre alveola structure. Each endcap is divided into 2 halves, or Dees. Each Dee holds 3 662 crystals. These are contained in 138 standard SCs and 18 special partial supercrystals on the inner and outer circumference. The crystals and SCs are arranged in a rectangular x-ygrid, with the crystals pointing at a focus 1 300 mm beyond the interaction point, giving off-pointing angles ranging from 2 to 8 degrees. The crystals have a rear face cross section 3030 mm2, a front face cross section 28.62 28.62 mm2and a length of 220 mm (24.7 X0). The endcaps crystal volume is 2.90 m3and the weight is 24.0 t. The layout of the calorimeter is shown in ﬁgure 4.5. Figure 4.6shows the barrel already mounted inside the hadron calorimeter, while ﬁgure 4.7shows a picture of a Dee. The number of scintillation photons emitted by the crystals and the ampliﬁcation of the APD are both temperature dependent. Both variations are negative with increasing temperature. The overall variation of the response to incident electrons with temperature has been measured in test beam [74] to be ( 3:80:4)%C 1. The temperature of the system has therefore to be maintained constant to high

The nominal operating temperature of the CMS ECAL is 18°C. The cooling system has to comply with this severe thermal requirement. The system employs water ﬂow to stabilise the detector. In the barrel, each supermodule is independently supplied – 93 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004 Figure 4.4: Front view of a module equipped with the crystals. with water at 18°C. The water runs through a thermal screen placed in front of the crystals which thermally decouples them from the silicon tracker, and through pipes embedded in the aluminium grid, connected in parallel. Beyond the grid, a 9 mm thick layer of insulating foam (Armaﬂex) is placed to minimise the heat ﬂowing from the read-out electronics towards the crystals. Return pipes distribute the water through a manifold to a set of aluminium cooling bars. These bars are in close contact with the very front end electronics (VFE) cards and absorb the heat dissipated by the components mounted on these cards. A thermally conductive paste (gap ﬁller 2000, produced by Bergquist) is used to provide a good contact between the electronic components and a metal plate facing each board. This plate is coupled to the cooling bar by a conductive pad (ultrasoft gap pad, also produced by Bergquist). Both the gap pad and the gap ﬁller have been irradiated with twice the dose expected in the ECAL endcaps after 10 years at the LHC and have shown no change in character or loss of performance. Extended tests of the cooling system have been performed with good results [74]. Residual effects caused by a possible variation of the power dissipated by the

The conclusion is that contributions to the constant term of the energy resolution due to thermal ﬂuctuations will be negligible, even without temperature corrections. – 94 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004 Crystals in a supermodulePreshower Supercrystals Modules Preshower End-cap crystalsDeeFigure 4.5: Layout of the CMS electromagnetic calorimeter showing the arrangement of crystal modules, supermodules and endcaps, with the preshower in front.

In addition, because of the small light yield of the crystals, they should amplify and be insensitive to particles traversing them (nuclear counter effect ). The conﬁguration of the magnetic ﬁeld and the expected level of radiation led to different choices: avalanche photodiodes in the barrel and vacuum phototriodes in the endcaps. The lower quantum efﬁciency and internal gain of the vacuum phototriodes, compared to the avalanche photodiodes, is offset by their larger surface coverage on the back face of the crystals. 4.3.1 Barrel: avalanche photodiodes In the barrel, the photodetectors are Hamamatsu type S8148 reverse structure (i.e., with the bulk n-type silicon behind the p-n junction) avalanche photodiodes (APDs) specially developed for the CMS ECAL. Each APD has an active area of 5 5 mm2and a pair is mounted on each crystal. They are operated at gain 50 and read out in parallel. The main properties of the APDs at gain 50 and 18°C are listed in table 4.1. The sensitivity to the nuclear counter effect is given by the effective thickness of 6 mm, which translates into a

Each APD was tested to breakdown and required to show no signiﬁcant noise increase up to a gain of 300. The screening and testing aimed to ensure reliable operation for 10 years under high luminosity LHC conditions for over 99% of the APDs installed in the ECAL [75]. Based on tests with hadron irradiations [76] it is expected that the dark current after such operation will have risen to about 5 mA, but that no other properties will have changed. Small samples of APDs were irradiated with a251Cf source to monitor the effectiveness of the screening procedure in selecting radiation resistant APDs. The gain stability directly affects the ECAL energy resolution. Since the APD gain has a high dependence on the bias voltage (a V=1=MdM=dV'3:1%=V at gain 50), to keep this contribution to the resolution at the level of per mille, the APDs require a very stable power supply system: the stability of the voltage has to be of the order of few tens of mV .
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||This requirement applies to all the electrical system characteristics: noise, ripple, voltage regulation and absolute precision, for short and long term periods. A custom high voltage (HV) power supply system has been designed for the CMS ECAL in collaboration with the CAEN Company [77]. To remain far from high doses of radiation, the HV system is located in the CMS service cavern, some 120 m away from the detector. The HV channels are ﬂoating and use sense wires to correct for variations in the voltage drop on the leads. The system is based on a standard control crate (SY1527) hosting 8 boards expressly designed for this application (A1520E). The SY1527 integrate a PC capable of communicating with the board controller via an internal bus and different interfaces are available to integrate the SY1527 on the ECAL detector control system (DCS). The board design is based on a modular concept so that each HV channel is implemented on a separate module and up to 9 channels can be hosted on a single A1520E board. Each channel can give a bias voltage to 50 APD pairs from 0 to 500 V with maximum current of 15 mA. In total, there are 18 crates and 144 boards. Temperature – 97 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004drift compensation is possible due to the presence on the crate of temperature probes that can be used to monitor the environment temperature for adjustments of the voltage setting. The operating gain of 50 requires a voltage between 340 and 430 V . The APDs are sorted according to their operating voltage into bins 5 V wide, and then paired such that each pair has a mean gain of 50. Each pair is mounted in parallel in a capsule, a moulded receptacle with foam, which is then glued on
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||the back of each crystal. The capsules are connected to the read-out electronics by Kapton ﬂexible printed circuit boards of variable length, dictated by the capsule’s position within the submodule. Each capsule receives the bias voltage through an RC ﬁlter network and a protection resistor. One 100kW negative temperature coefﬁcient thermistor from Betatherm, used as temperature sensor, is embedded in every tenth APD capsule. There are twenty-two different types of capsules, differing by the Kapton length and by the presence of the thermistor. 4.3.2 Endcap: vacuum phototriodes In the endcaps, the photodetectors are vacuum phototriodes (VPTs) (type PMT188 from National Research Institute Electron in St. Petersburg). Vacuum phototriodes are photomultipliers having a single gain stage. These particular devices were developed specially for CMS [78] and have an anode of very ﬁne copper mesh (10 mm pitch) allowing them to operate in the 4-T magnetic ﬁeld. Each VPT is 25 mm in diameter, with an active area of approximately 280 mm2; one VPT is glued to the back of each crystal. One Betatherm thermistor is embedded into each supercrystal. The VPTs have a mean quantum efﬁciency of the bialkali photocathode (SbKCs) of 22% at 430 nm, and a mean gain of 10.2 at zero ﬁeld. When placed in a strong axial magnetic ﬁeld, the response is slightly reduced and there is a modest variation of response with the angle of the VPT axis with respect to the ﬁeld over the range of angles relevant to the CMS endcaps (6to 26). The mean response in a magnetic ﬁeld of 4 T, with the VPT axis at 15to the ﬁeld direction, is typically >90% of that in zero ﬁeld [79]. All VPTs are tested by the manufacturer before delivery, without an applied magnetic ﬁeld. All VPTs are also tested on receipt by CMS
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||to determine their response as a function of magnetic ﬁeld up to 1.8 T. Each device is measured at a set of angles with respect to the applied ﬁeld, spanning the range of angles covered by the endcaps. In addition, at least 10% of the tubes, selected at random, are also tested in a 4-T superconducting magnet, at a ﬁxed angle of 15, to verify satisfactory operation at the full ﬁeld of CMS. The estimated doses and particle ﬂuences for 10 years of LHC operation are 0.5 kGy and 51013n/cm2at the outer circumference of the endcaps and 20 kGy and 7 1014n/cm2atjhj= 2.6. Sample faceplates from every glass production batch were irradiated with a60Co source to 20 kGy. The faceplates were required to show a transmission loss, integrated over the wavelength range corresponding to PbWO 4emission, of less than 10%. Irradiation of VPTs in a nuclear reactor to 71014n/cm2showed a loss in anode sensitivity entirely consistent with discolouration of the faceplate caused by the accompanying gamma dose (100 kGy) [80]. Irradiations of tubes biased to the working voltage, with both gammas and neutrons showed no adverse effects, apart from an increase in anode current, attributable to the production of Cerenkov light in the faceplates. – 98 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004The VPTs are operated with the photocathode at ground potential and the dynode and anode biased at +600 V and +800 V respectively. The high voltage system is based (like the APD system) on CAEN SY1527 standard control crates, although for the VPTs, the crates are equipped with standard 12-channel A1735P boards, each channel rated at 1.5 kV and 7 mA. At the operating bias, the VPT gain is close to saturation thus the voltages do not have to be controlled very precisely. However, care must be taken to minimise
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||ripple and noise, since these would feed directly into the input of the sensitive preampliﬁer that is connected to the anode. Filtering is achieved with RC networks mounted inside the supercrystals (SC), close to the VPTs. An entire endcap is biased using one SY1527 crate equipped with just two A1735P boards. On each board, only eight of the twelve output channels will initially be used, leaving four spare channels. The spare outputs may be used at a later stage, if noisy channels develop which can be recovered by operating at a lower bias voltage. The HV from the CAEN power supplies is transmitted to the SCs via a custom designed HV distribution system which provides hard-wired protection against over-voltage and over-current, and sensitive current monitoring. For each endcap, this system is housed in ﬁve crates. Each crate hosts up to ﬁve input cards, receiving the HV from the power supplies, and up to six output cards, with each output card serving up to twelve SCs. The HV supplies and distribution system are mounted in two racks (one for each endcap) located in the Service Cavern. Each SC is served by two coaxial cables (one for the anode, one for the dynode) running from the Service Cavern to the detector, via intermediate patch panels. The total cable length is approximately 120 m and the cable capacitance forms part of the ﬁlter network. Inside an SC the HV is distributed to the VPTs via ﬁve ﬁlter cards, each serving ﬁve VPTs. The spread in anode sensitivity among the VPTs is 25% (RMS). They are therefore sorted into six groups which are distributed on the endcaps with the highest sensitivities at the outer circumference grading to the lowest sensitivities at the inner circumference. This arrangement provides a roughly constant sensitivity to the transverse
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||energy across the endcaps. The anode sensitivity of a VPT may show a dependence on count rate (anode current) under certain conditions. For example, in the absence of a magnetic ﬁeld, if the count rate falls to a few Hz, following a period of high rate operation, the anode sensitivity may rise suddenly and take several hours to return to the nominal value. The magnitude of the effect may vary from a few percent to a few tens of percent. In the presence of a strong magnetic ﬁeld (as in normal CMS operation), the effect is strongly suppressed or absent. Nevertheless, it has been judged prudent to incorporate a light pulser system on the ECAL endcaps. This delivers a constant background rate of at least 100 Hz of pulses of approximately 50 GeV equivalent energy to all VPTs, thus ensuring that they are kept “active”, even in the absence of LHC interactions. The system consists of a control and trigger unit located in the Service Cavern, and sets of pulsed light sources mounted on the circumference of each Dee. The light is produced by Luxeon III light emitting diodes (type LXHL-PR09), whose peak emission wavelength is 455 nm. The LEDs are driven by high output current op-amps (LT6300 from Linear Technology). The drive pulses have amplitudes of 1.2 A and a widths of 80 ns. A single light source consists of a cluster of seven LEDs and associated drive-circuits. These are conﬁgured singly or in pairs, with the drive- circuits and LEDs mounted on double-sided printed circuit boards housed within metal enclosures. There are four such enclosures distributed around the circumference of each Dee, housing 19 light sources. A schematic representation of the system for distributing the light pulses is shown in ﬁgure 4.8. – 99 – 2008 JINST 3

An all-silica optical ﬁbre (CF01493-43 from OFS (Furukawa)) is inserted into a hole drilled into the lens of each LED and collects light by proximity focusing. The seven ﬁbres from a given light source are combined into a single bundle that transports light to a diffusing sphere which has a dual role, acting also as part of the distribution network of the laser monitoring system. Light from each diffusing sphere is distributed to up to 220 individual detector channels through the set of optical ﬁbres that also carry the laser monitoring pulses. Light is injected via the rear face of a crystal, which carries the VPT, and reaches the VPT via reﬂection from the front of the crystal. The system is synchronized to pulse during a fraction of the 3 ms abort gaps that occur during every 89 ms cycle of the LHC circulating beams. 4.4 On-detector electronics The ECAL read-out has to acquire the small signals of the photo-detectors with high speed and precision. Every bunch crossing digital sums representing the energy deposit in a trigger tower are generated and sent to the trigger system. The digitized data are stored during the Level-1 trigger latency of3ms. The on-detector electronics has been designed to read a complete trigger tower ( 5 5 crystals inhf) or a super-crystal for EB and EE respectively. It consists of ﬁve Very Front End (VFE) boards, one Front End (FE) board, two (EB) or six (EE) Gigabit Optical Hybrids (GOH), one Low V oltage Regulator card (LVR) and a motherboard. The motherboard is located in front of the cooling bars. It connects to
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||25 photo-detectors and to the temperature sensors using Kapton ﬂexible printed circuit boards and coaxial cables for EB and EE respectively. In the case of the EB the motherboard distributes and ﬁlters the APD bias voltage. Two motherboards are connected to one CAEN HV supply located at a distance of about 120m with remote sensing. In the case of the EE the operating voltages for the VPTs are distributed and ﬁltered by a separate HV ﬁlter card, hosting as well the decoupling capacitor for the anode signals. Five of these cards serving ﬁve VPTs each are installed into each super-crystal. One LVR and ﬁve VFE cards plug into the motherboard. Each LVR card [81] uses 11 radiation-hard low voltage regulators (LHC4913) developed by ST-microelectronics and the RD49 project at CERN.

A control token ring connects groups of FE cards, providing Level-1 trigger (TRG) and clock (CLK) signals, together with control data in and out (CTRL data). protection, output current limitation and an inhibit input. The output voltages of 2: 5V are dis- tributed to the FE card and via the motherboard to the VFE cards. Three Detector Control Unit (DCU) ASICs on each LVR card, interfaced to the FE card, monitor all input and output voltages. All regulators, excluding the one providing power to the control interface of the FE card, can be powered down remotely by an external inhibit. Four LVR cards are connected by a passive low voltage distribution (LVD) block to one radiation and magnetic ﬁeld tolerant Wiener low voltage power supply located about 30 m away in racks attached to the magnet yoke. The signals are pre-ampliﬁed and shaped and then ampliﬁed by three ampliﬁers with nominal gains of 1, 6 and 12. This functionality is built into the Multi Gain Pre-Ampliﬁer (MGPA) [82], an ASIC developed in 0: 25mm technology. The full scale signals of the APDs and VPTs are 60 pC and 12.8 pC corresponding to 1:5 TeV and 1.6–3.1 TeV for EB and EE respectively. The shaping is done by a CR-RC network with a shaping time of 40 ns. The MGPA has a power consumption of 580 mW at 2.5 V . The output pulse non-linearity is less than 1%. The noise for gain 12 is about 8000e for the APD conﬁguration and about 4000e for the VPT conﬁguration. The MGPA contains three programmable 8-bit DACs to adjust the baseline to the ADC inputs. An integrated test-pulse generator with an amplitude adjustable by means of an
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||8-bit DAC allows a test of the read-out electronics over the full dynamic range. A schematic view of the signal read-out is given in ﬁgure 4.9. The 3 analog output signals of the MGPA are digitized in parallel by a multi-channel, 40-MHz, 12-bit ADC, the AD41240 [83], developed in 0: 25mm technology. It has an effective number of bits of 10.9. An integrated logic – 101 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004selects the highest non-saturated signal as output and reports the 12 bits of the corresponding ADC together with two bits coding the ADC number. If the read-out switches to a lower gain as the pulse grows, it is prevented from immediately reverting to the higher gain when the pulse falls: once the pulse has declined to the point where it could be read out at the higher gain again, the read-out is then forced to continue reading out at the lower gain for the next ﬁve samples. A radiation-hard buffer (LVDS_RX) developed in 0: 25mm technology, adapts the low voltage differential output signals of the AD41240 to the single ended CMOS inputs on the FE card. Five identical read-out channels are integrated into a VFE card, together with a Detector Control Unit (DCU) for the measurement of the APD leakage currents and the read-out of the thermistors. The noise obtained with the VFE cards installed into supermodules is typically 1.1, 0.75 and 0.6 ADC counts for gains 12, 6 and 1 respectively. This corresponds to 40 MeV for gain 12. The FE card [84] stores the digitized data during the Level-1 trigger latency in 256-word- deep dual-ported memories, so called pipelines. Five such pipelines and the logic to calculate the energy sum of the 5 channels once every bunch crossing are integrated into an ASIC developed in 0: 25mm technology
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||called FENIX. Each VFE card is serviced by a FENIX chip. Thus the energy is summed in strips of 5 crystals along f. In the case of the EE the ﬁve strip sums are transmitted by ﬁve GOHs (see below) to the off-detector electronics Trigger Concentrator Card (TCC), while in the case of the EB a sixth FENIX sums the ﬁve strip sums and calculates the “ﬁne-grain” electromagnetic bit, set to identify electromagnetic shower candidates on the basis of the energy proﬁle of the trigger tower. The trigger tower energy sum together with the ﬁne-grain bit is transmitted using one GOH to the TCC. On receipt of a Level-1 trigger the corresponding data, ten 40-MHz samples per channel, are transmitted in 7:5ms to the off-detector electronics Data Concentrator Card (DCC) using an identical GOH. The Clock and Control Unit (CCU) ASIC together with the LVDS_MUX ASIC provide the interface to the token rings. The ECAL serial digital data links are based on the technology developed for the CMS Tracker analog links (section 3.3). The GOH consists of a data serializer and laser driver chip, the GOL, and a laser diode with an attached ﬁbre pigtail. Fibres, ﬁbre interconnections and a 12-channel NGK receiver module complete the optical link system. It uses single mode ﬁbres op- erating at 1310 nm wavelength over a distance of about 100 m. The ﬁbre attenuation of 0:04dB is negligible. The optical links are operated at 800Mbit=s. The VFE and FE electronics are controlled using a 40-MHz digital optical link system, con- trolled by the off-detector Clock and Control System (CCS) boards. A 12-ﬁbre ribbon is connected to the token ring link board, generating an electrical control ring, the token ring. Each supermodule has 8 token rings which connect to groups of eight to ten FE
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||cards including the two FE cards of the laser monitoring electronics module (MEM). The system has redundancy, as long as there are no two consecutive FE cards malfunctioning, by means of two independent bi-directional optical links, using 4 ﬁbres each. It provides fast and slow control functions. While the fast control transmits the level one trigger information and the 40-MHz clock, the slow control comprises the conﬁguration of the FE and VFE electronics as well as the read-out of status information, temperatures, voltages and APD leakage currents. – 102 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004 TCC 9 SLBsCCS 8mFECs FE DCCTrigger DataDAQ DataTTS RCTData DAQDat a SRPOnes e t per SMTTC TCC 9 SLBsTCC 9 SLBsCCS 8mFECsCCS 8mFECs FEFE DCCDCCTrigger DataDAQ DataTTS RCTData DAQDat a SRPSRPOnes e t per SMTTCFigure 4.10: Schematic view of ECAL off-detector electronics. 4.5 Off-detector electronics 4.5.1 Global architecture The ECAL off-detector read-out and trigger architecture [85, 86] is illustrated schematically in ﬁg- ure4.10. The system is composed of different electronic boards sitting in 18 VME-9U crates (the CCS, TCC and DCC modules) and in 1 VME-6U crate (the selective read-out processor, SRP, sys- tem). The system serves both the DAQ and the trigger paths. In the DAQ path, the DCC performs data read-out and data reduction based on the selective read-out ﬂags computed by the SRP system. In the trigger path, at each bunch crossing, trigger primitive generation started in the FE boards is ﬁnalized and synchronized in the TCC before transmission to the regional calorimeter trigger. The clock and control system (CCS) board distributes the system clock, trigger and broadcast commands, conﬁgures the FE electronics and provides an interface to the trigger throttling system. The TTC signals are translated and encoded by suppression of clock edges and sent to the mezza- nine Front End Controller
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||cards (mFEC). The mFEC interfaces optically with a FE token ring. The 8 mFECs of the CCS board control a supermodule. The trigger concentration card (TCC) [87] main functionalities include the completion of the trigger primitive generation and their transmission to the synchronization and link board (SLB) mezzanines [88] at each bunch crossing, the classiﬁcation of each trigger tower and its transmission to the Selective Read-out Processor at each Level-1 trigger accept signal, and the storage of the trigger primitives during the Level-1 latency for subsequent reading by the DCC. Each TCC collects trigger data from 68 FE boards in the barrel, corresponding to a super- module, and from 48 FE boards in the endcaps corresponding to the inner or outer part of a 20f sector. In the endcaps, trigger primitive computation is completed in the TCCs, which must per- form a mapping between the collected pseudo-strips trigger data from the different supercrystals and the associated trigger towers. The encoded trigger primitives (8 bits for the nonlinear represen- tation of the trigger tower ETplus the ﬁne-grain bit) are time aligned and sent to the regional trigger processors by the SLB. The trigger primitives are stored in the TCC during the Level-1 latency for subsequent reading by the DCC. In the barrel region a single TCC is interfaced with 1 DCC. In the endcap region, a DCC serves 4 TCCs covering a 40sector. – 103 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004The data concentration card (DCC) [89, 90] is responsible for collecting crystal data from up to 68 FE boards. Two extra FE links are dedicated to the read-out of laser monitoring data (PN diodes). The DCC also collects trigger data transmitted from the TCC modules and the selective read-out ﬂags transmitted from the SRP system. A data suppression factor near 20 is
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||attained using a programmable selective read-out algorithm. When operating in the selective read-out mode the SRP ﬂags indicate the level of suppression that must be applied to the crystal data of a given FE read-out. For the application of zero suppression, time samples pass through a ﬁnite impulse response ﬁlter with 6 consecutive positions and the result is compared to a threshold. If any time sample of the 6 has been digitized at a gain other than the maximum, then zero suppression is not applied to the channel. Data integrity is checked, including veriﬁcation of the event-fragment header, in particular the data synchronization check, veriﬁcation of the event-fragment word count and veriﬁcation of the event-fragment parity bits. Identiﬁed error conditions, triggered by input event-fragment checks, link errors, data timeouts or buffer memory overﬂows are ﬂagged in the DCC error registers and incremented in associated error counters. Error conditions are ﬂagged in the DCC event header. Input and output memory occupancy is monitored to prevent buffer overﬂows. If a ﬁrst oc- cupancy level is reached, the Trigger Throttling System (TTS) signal Warning Overﬂow is issued, requesting a reduction of the trigger rate. In a second level a TTS signal Busy inhibits new trig- gers and empty events (events with just the header words and trailer) are stored. DCC events are transmitted to the central CMS DAQ using a S-LINK64 data link interface at a maximum data rate of 528 MB/s, while an average transmission data ﬂow of 200 MB/s is expected after ECAL data reduction. Laser triggers (for crystal transparency monitoring) will occur with a programmable frequency and synchronously with the LHC gap. No data reduction is applied for these events, which are read-out following a TTC test enable command. A VME memory is used for local DAQ, allowing VME access
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||to physics events and laser events in spy mode. The selective read-out processor (SRP) [91] is responsible for the implementation of the se- lective read-out algorithm. The system is composed by a single 6U-VME crate with twelve iden- tical algorithm boards (AB). The AB computes the selective read-out ﬂags in different calorimeter partitions. The ﬂags are composed of 3 bits, indicating the suppression level that must be applied to the associated read-out units. 4.5.2 The trigger and read-out paths The ECAL data, in the form of trigger primitives, are sent to the Level-1 calorimeter trigger proces- sor, for each bunch crossing. The trigger primitives each refer to a single trigger tower and consist of the summed transverse energy deposited in the tower, and the ﬁne-grain bit, which characterizes the lateral proﬁle of the electromagnetic shower. The accept signal, for accepted events, is returned from the global trigger in about 3 ms. The selected events are read out through the data acquisition system to the Filter Farm where further rate reduction is performed using the full detector data. The read-out system is structured in sets of 5 5 crystals. The FE card stores the data, in 256- clock cycles deep memory banks, awaiting a Level-1 trigger decision during at most 128 bunch crossings after the collision occurred. It implements most of the Trigger Primitives Generation (TPG) pipeline (section 4.5.3). – 104 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004In the barrel, these 5 5 crystal sets correspond to the trigger towers. Each trigger tower is divided into 5 f-oriented strips, whose energy deposits are summed by the FE board trigger pipeline to give the total transverse energy of the tower, called the main trigger primitive. Each FE is served by two optical links for sending the data and trigger primitives respectively and a third
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||electrical serial link which transmits the clock, control and Level-1 trigger signals. In the endcaps, the read-out modularity maps onto the 5 5 mechanical units (supercrystals). However the sizes of the trigger towers vary in order to approximately follow the h,fgeometry of the HCAL and Level-1 trigger processor. The supercrystals are divided into groups of 5 contiguous crystals. These groups are of variable shape and referred to as pseudo-strips. The trigger towers are composed of several pseudo-strips and may extend over more than one supercrystal. Since the read-out structure does not match the trigger structure, only the pseudo-strip summations are performed on the detector. The total transverse energy of the trigger tower is computed by the off-detector electronics. Hence, each endcap FE board is served by 6 optical links, 5 of them being used to transmit the trigger primitives. As in the barrel an electrical serial link transmits the clock, control and Level-1 trigger signals. After time alignment the ECAL trigger primitives are sent at 1.2 Gb/s to the regional calorime- ter trigger, via 10-m-long electrical cables, where together with HCAL trigger primitives, the elec- tron/photon and jets candidates are computed as well as the total transverse energy. 4.5.3 Algorithms performed by the trigger primitive generation The TPG logic implemented on the FE boards combines the digitized samples delivered by the VFE boards to determine the trigger primitives and the bunch crossing to which they should be assigned. The logic must reconstruct the signal amplitude to be assigned to each bunchcrossing from the continuous stream of successive digitizations. The TPG logic is implemented as a pipeline, operated at the LHC bunch crossing frequency. The trigger primitives are delivered to the regional calorimeter trigger after a constant latency of 52 clock cycles, of which 22 are used for transmission over the
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||optical ﬁbres and cables. The signal processing performed in the VFE and FE barrel electronics has a total duration of only 17 clock cycles. The remaining part of the latency is mainly due to formatting and time alignment of the digital signals. Ideally, the output of this processing should be a stream of zeroes, unless there is a signal in the tower resulting from a bunch crossing exactly 17 clock cycles before. In this case the output is a word encoding the summed transverse energy in the tower together with the ﬁne-grain bit. The endcap pipeline is split between the on-detector and off-detector electronics and implements very similar algorithms. The trigger primitives are expected to be delivered to the regional calorimeter trigger in 50 clock cycles in the endcap case. 4.5.4 Classiﬁcation performed by the selective read-out About 100kB per event has been allocated for ECAL data. The full ECAL data for an event, if all channels are read out, exceeds this target by a factor of nearly 20. Reduction of the data volume, selective read-out, can be performed by the Selective Read-out Processor [86, 91] so that the suppression applied to a channel takes account of energy deposits in the vicinity. For the measure of the energy in a region, the trigger tower sums are used. In the barrel the read-out – 105 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004modularity corresponds exactly to the 5 5-crystal trigger towers. In the endcap, the situation is more complex. The simpliﬁed and illustrative description below is given for the barrel case. The selective read-out algorithm classiﬁes the trigger towers of the ECAL into 3 classes using the Level-1 trigger primitives. The energy deposited in each trigger tower is compared to 2 thresholds. Trigger towers with an energy above the higher threshold are classiﬁed as
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||high interest trigger towers, those with an energy between the 2 thresholds as medium interest, and those with an energy below the lower threshold as low interest trigger towers. These classiﬁcations can be used ﬂexibly to implement a range of algorithms by using differ- ent thresholds to deﬁne the classes, and different suppression levels for the read-out of the channels within each class. The algorithm currently used in the simulation provides adequate data reduction even at high luminosity. The algorithm functions as follows: if a trigger tower belongs to the high interest class (E T>5 GeV) then the crystals of this trigger tower and of its neighbour trigger towers (225 crystals in total in the barrel case) are read with no zero suppression. If a trigger tower belongs to the medium interest class (E T>2:5 GeV), then the crystals of this trigger tower (25 crystals in the barrel case) are read with no suppression. If a trigger tower belongs to the low interest class and it is not the neighbour of a high interest trigger tower, then the crystals in it are read with zero suppression at about 3s noise. For debugging purposes, the selective read-out can be deactivated and either a global zero suppression (same threshold for every channel) or no zero suppression applied. Even when the selective read-out is not applied the selective read-out ﬂags are inserted into the data stream and can be used ofﬂine for debugging purposes. 4.6 Preshower detector The principal aim of the CMS Preshower detector is to identify neutral pions in the endcaps within a ﬁducial region 1: 653<jhj<2:6. It also helps the identiﬁcation of electrons against minimum ionizing particles, and improves the position determination of electrons and photons with high granularity. 4.6.1 Geometry The Preshower is a sampling calorimeter with two layers:
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||lead radiators initiate electromagnetic showers from incoming photons/electrons whilst silicon strip sensors placed after each radia- tor measure the deposited energy and the transverse shower proﬁles. The total thickness of the Preshower is 20 cm. The material thickness of the Preshower traversed at h=1:653 before reaching the ﬁrst sensor plane is 2 X0, followed by a further 1 X0before reaching the second plane. Thus about 95% of single incident photons start showering before the second sensor plane. The orientation of the strips in the two planes is orthogonal. A major design consideration is that all lead is covered by silicon sensors, including the effects of shower spread, primary vertex spread etc. For optimum Level-1 trigger performance the proﬁle of the outer edge of the lead should follow the shape of the ECAL crystals behind it. For the inner radius the effect of the exact proﬁling of the lead is far less – 106 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004 Figure 4.11: Photograph of a complete type-1 ladder, with an inset showing details of a micro- module. critical, and thus a circular shape has been chosen. The lead planes are arranged in two Dees, one on each side of the beam pipe, with the same orientation as the crystal Dees. Each silicon sensor measures 63 63 mm2, with an active area of 61 61 mm2divided into 32 strips (1.9 mm pitch). The nominal thickness of the silicon is 320 mm; a minimum ionizing particle (MIP) will deposit 3.6 fC of charge in this thickness (at normal incidence). The sensors are precisely glued to ceramic supports, which also support the front-end electronics assembly (see below), and this is in turn glued to an aluminium tile that allows a 2 mm overlap of the active part of the sensors in the direction parallel to
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||the strips. In order to improve noise performance the tile is constructed in two parts, with a glass ﬁbre insulation in between. The combination of sensor + front-end electronics + supports is known as a micromodule. The micromodules are placed on baseplates in groups of 7, 8 or 10 that, when coupled to an electronics system motherboard (SMB) placed above the micromodules, form a ladder. The spacing between silicon strips (at the edges) in adjacent micromodules within a ladder is 2.4 mm, whilst the spacing between strips in adjacent ladders is normally 2.5 mm. For the region where the two Dees join this spacing is increased to 3.0 mm. Figure 4.11 shows a complete ladder (Type-1 for 8 micromodules) and an inset shows the micromodule. The ladders are attached to the radiators in an x-yconﬁguration. Around 500 ladders are required, corresponding to a total of around 4 300 micromodules and 137000 individual read-out channels. Further details of the layout can be found in [92]. 4.6.2 Preshower electronics Each silicon sensor is DC-coupled to a front-end ASIC (PACE3 [93]) that performs preampliﬁca- tion, signal shaping and voltage sampling. Data is clocked into an on-chip high dynamic range 192-cell deep analogue memory at 40 MHz. – 107 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004For each Level-1 trigger received, 3 consecutive cells of the memory, corresponding to time samples on the baseline, near the peak and after the peak, are read out for all 32 channels through a 20 MHz multiplexer. The PACE3 has a switchable gain: • Low gain: For normal physics running with a large dynamic range (0-1600 fC) with a S/N of around 3 for a single MIP; • High gain: For MIP calibration purposes [94], with a reduced dynamic range (0-200 fC) but with a S/N approaching 10 for a single
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||MIP. The PACE3 are soldered to front-end hybrids that contain embedded polyimide cables to connect to the SMBs. The SMBs contain AD41240 12-bit ADCs that digitize the data from 1 or 2 PACE3. The digital data are then formatted and packaged by a second Preshower ASIC known as the K-chip [95]. The K-chip also performs synchronization checks on the data, adds bunch/event counter information to the data packets and transmits the data to the Preshower-DCC (see below) via gigabit optical hybrids (GOH). The SMB also contains an implementation of the CMS tracker control system. Groups of up to 12 ladders are connected via polyimide cables to form control rings. Off- detector CCS cards (identical to those of the ECAL except not all FEC mezzanines are mounted for the Preshower) communicate via digital optical hybrids (DOH) mounted on 2 of the SMBs in each control ring. The full Preshower comprises 4 planes of 12 control rings each. The Preshower-DCC [96] is based on the DCC of the ECAL except it is a modular design incorporating a VME host board mounted with optoRx12 [97] mezzanines. The modular design has allowed a development collaboration with the TOTEM experiment which uses the same com- ponents but in a different manner. The optoRx12 incorporates an NGK 12-way optical receiver and an Altera Stratix GX FPGA that performs data deserialization, pedestal subtraction, common-mode noise reduction, bunch crossing assignment, charge reconstruction and zero suppression [98]. The sparsiﬁed data from up to 3 optoRx12 are merged by another FPGA on the host board that then transmits data packets to the event builder via an Slink64 interface. The host board also provides data spying as well as TTC and VME interfaces. A provision has been made on the host board to allow the plug-in of an additional mezzanine board
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||mounted with FPGAs/processors that could provide more data reduction power if necessary in the future. 4.7 ECAL detector control system The ECAL Detector Control System (DCS) comprises the monitoring of the detector status, in particular various kinds of environmental parameters, as well as the ECAL safety system (ESS), which will generate alarms and hardwired interlocks in case of situations which could lead to damaging the detector hardware. It consists of the following sub-systems: ECAL Safety System (ESS), Precision Temperature Monitoring (PTM), Humidity Monitoring (HM), High V oltage (HV), Low V oltage (LV) and monitoring of the laser operation, the cooling system and of the parameters (temperatures in capsules, temperatures on the printed circuit boards, APD leakage currents) read out by the DCUs on the VFE and LVR boards. Further details on the ECAL DCS are available [99]. – 108 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004The whole DCS software is based on the commercial SCADA package PVSS II (chapter 9). A distributed system is built out of several applications dedicated to the DCS sub-systems. Every application is implemented as a Finite State Machine (FSM) and linked to a supervisory level, which summarizes the overall ECAL DCS status and itself incorporates a FSM. Finally, this ECAL DCS supervisor is linked to the general CMS DCS supervisory node, in order to communicate the status and alarms and to receive commands which are propagated down to the relevant sub-systems. 4.7.1 Safety system The purpose of the ESS [100] is to monitor the air temperature of the VFE and FE environment (expected to be around 25–30°C) and the water leakage detection cable, which is routed inside the electronics compartment, to control the proper functioning of the cooling system and to automati- cally perform pre-deﬁned safety actions and generate interlocks in case of any alarm situation. One
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||pair of temperature sensors is placed at the centre of each module. The read-out system, with full built-in redundancy, is independent of the DAQ and control links and based on a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) situated in the Service Cavern. In case of any critical reading hardwired interlock signals will be routed to the relevant crates in order to switch off the HV and LV and/or the cooling PLC in order to stop the water ﬂow on a certain cooling line. The proper functioning of the ESS PLC itself is monitored by the general CMS detector safety system. 4.7.2 Temperature The number of scintillation photons emitted by the crystals and the ampliﬁcation of the APD are both temperature dependent, as described in section 4.2. Therefore a major task for the ECAL DCS is the monitoring of the system’s temperature and the veriﬁcation that the required temperature stability of (180:05)°C of the crystal volume and the APDs is achieved. The PTM is designed to read out thermistors, placed on both sides of the crystal volume, with a relative precision better than 0.01°C. In total there are ten sensors per supermodule. Two immersion probes measure the temperature of the incoming and outgoing cooling water, whereas two sensors per module, one on the grid and one on the thermal screen side of the crystal volume, monitor the crystal temperature. The read-out is based on the Embedded Local Monitoring Board (ELMB) developed by ATLAS which functions completely independently of the DAQ and control links. In addition, sensors ﬁxed to the back surface of every tenth crystal in the barrel, and one in 25 crystals in the endcap, are read out by the DCUs placed on the VFE boards. With this temperature monitoring it has been shown that the water cooling system can indeed ensure
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||the required temperature stability [74]. 4.7.3 Dark current The APD dark current will increase during CMS operation due to bulk damage of the silicon structure by neutrons. Part of this damage anneals, but the overall effect will be an increase in electronics noise, due to an increasing dark current, over the lifetime of the detector. The dark current of all APD channels will be continuously monitored. – 109 – 2008 JINST 3 S080044.7.4 HV and LV The DCS system operates the CAEN HV system via an OPC server. The functionalities include the independent conﬁguration of the HV channels with various set of voltages, the monitor of the voltage and the current delivered by each channel and the database recording of the settings. The ECAL Safety System can switch off the HV via the individual board interlocks. The ECAL ampliﬁcation and digitization electronics located on the VFE electronics cards require a very stable low voltage to maintain constant signal ampliﬁcation. The system uses Low V oltage Regulators that guarantee the required stability of the signal ampliﬁcation. The Low V olt- age Regulator Boards are equipped with DCUs that measure the voltages and these measurements are read via the Token Ring. Overall the power is supplied by MARATON crates (WIENER), which are operated and monitored by the DCS. 4.8 Detector calibration Calibration is a severe technical challenge for the operation of the CMS ECAL. Many small effects which are negligible at low precision need to be treated with care as the level of precision of a few per mille is approached. ECAL calibration is naturally seen as composed of a global component, giving the absolute energy scale, and a channel-to-channel relative component, which is referred to as intercalibration. The essential issues are uniformity over the whole ECAL and stability, so that showers
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||in different locations in the ECAL in data recorded at different times are accurately related to each other. The main source of channel-to-channel response variation in the barrel is the crystal-to-crystal variation of scintillation light yield which has an RMS of 8% within most supermodules, al- though the total variation among all barrel crystals is 15%. In the endcap the VPT signal yield, the product of the gain, quantum efﬁciency and photocathode area, has an RMS variation of al- most 25%. Preliminary estimates of the intercalibration coefﬁcients are obtained from laboratory measurements of crystal light yield and photodetector/electronics response [101]. Applying this information reduces the channel-to-channel variation to less than 5% in the barrel and less than 10% in the endcaps. All 36 supermodules were commissioned in turn by operating them on a cosmic ray stand for a period of about one week. A muon traversing the full length of a crystal deposits an energy of approximately 250 MeV , permitting intercalibration information to be obtained for the barrel ECAL [102]. In 2006, nine supermodules were intercalibrated with high energy electrons (90 and 120 GeV), in a geometrical conﬁguration that reproduced the incidence of particles during CMS operation. One of the supermodules was exposed to the beam on two occasions, separated by an interval of one month. The resulting sets of inter-calibration coefﬁcients are in close agreement, the distribution of differences having an RMS spread of 0.27%, indicating a reproducibility within the statistical precision of the individual measurements (ﬁgure 4.12). A comparison of the cosmic ray and high energy electron data demonstrates that the precision of the cosmic ray inter-calibration is better than 1.5% over most of the volume of a supermodule, rising to just above 2% at the outer end (corresponding to h1:5). The mean value of the precision

The reproducibility of the intercalibration coefﬁcients (RMS/p 2) is measured to be 0.2%. of the cosmic intercalibration, averaged over all the channels in the nine supermodules for which a comparison with electrons can be made, is 1.5% (ﬁgure 4.13). The ultimate intercalibration precision will be achieved in situ with physics events. As a ﬁrst step, imposing the f-independence of the energy deposited in the calorimeter can be used to rapidly conﬁrm, and possibly improve on, the start-up intercalibration within ﬁxed hregions. The intercalibration method that has been investigated in the most detail uses the momentum of isolated electrons measured in the tracker. These electrons, mainly from W!en, are abundant (s20 nb) and have a similar pTto the photons of the benchmark channel H!gg. A complementary method, not relying on the tracker momentum measurement, is based on p0!ggandh!ggmass recon- struction. Most methods of intercalibration will be local to a region of the ECAL, and a further step intercalibrating these regions to one another will be needed. This is a consequence of the signiﬁcant systematic variations that occur as a function of pseudorapidity such as (or including): the large variation of the thickness of the tracker material, the variation of the structure of the ECAL (both the major differences between the barrel and endcap, and the small continuous variation of the ge- ometry along the length of the barrel), and the variation of background characteristics for p0!gg. Over the period of time in which the physics events used to provide an intercalibration are taken the response must
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||remain stable to high precision. Where there is a source of signiﬁcant variation, as in the case of the changes in crystal transparency caused by irradiation and subsequent annealing, the variation must be precisely tracked by an independent measurement. The changes in crystal transparency are tracked and corrected using the laser monitoring system. – 111 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004 Entries per bin(1-Ccosm/Cbeam)Mean 0.000Sigma 0.015Figure 4.13: Distribution of the relative differences between the inter-calibration coefﬁcients mea- sured with high energy electrons and those obtained from cosmic ray muons. The ﬁnal goal of calibration is to achieve the most accurate energy measurements for elec- trons and photons. Different reconstruction algorithms are used to estimate the energy of different electromagnetic objects, i.e., unconverted photons, electrons and converted photons, each of them having their own correction functions. At present these “algorithmic” corrections are obtained from the simulated data by accessing the generated parameters of the Monte Carlo simulation. For some of the corrections, for example the containment corrections, this is an acceptable procedure provided that test beam data is used to verify the simulation, so that, in effect, the simulation is being used only as a means of interpolating and extrapolating from data taken in the test beam. In other cases, where the test beam provides no useful information, for example in issues related to conversions and bremsstrahlung radiation in the tracker material, it will be important to ﬁnd ways of using information that can be obtained from data taken in situ with the running detector. Two particularly useful channels which can be used to obtain such information, and also assist in the step of intercalibrating regions of the ECAL to one another, are under investigation: Z!e+e , andZ!m+m g(the photon coming from inner bremsstrahlung). – 112 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004 Figure 4.14: Simulation
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||of crystal transparency evolution at LHC based on test-beam results. For this illustrative example a luminosity of L=21033cm 2s 1was assumed, together with a machine cycle consisting of a 10 hour coast followed by 2 hours ﬁlling time. The crystal behaviour under irradiation was modeled on data taken during a crystal irradiation in the test beam. 4.9 Laser monitor system Although radiation resistant, ECAL PbWO 4crystals show a limited but rapid loss of optical trans- mission under irradiation due to the production of colour centres which absorb a fraction of the transmitted light. At the ECAL working temperature (18°C) the damage anneals and the balance between damage and annealing results in a dose-rate dependent equilibrium of the optical trans- mission, if the dose rate is constant. In the varying conditions of LHC running the result is a cyclic transparency behaviour between LHC collision runs and machine reﬁlls (ﬁgure 4.14). The magni- tude of the changes is dose-rate dependent, and is expected to range from 1 or 2 per cent at low luminosity in the barrel, to tens of per cent in the high hregions of the endcap at high luminosity. The performance of the calorimeter would be unacceptably degraded by these radiation induced transparency changes were they not measured and corrected for. The evolution of the crystal transparency is measured using laser pulses injected into the crystals via optical ﬁbres. The response is normalized by the laser pulse magnitude measured using silicon PN photodiodes. PN type photodiodes were chosen because of their very narrow de- pletion zone ( 7mm with +4 V reverse bias), making them much less sensitive to type inversion than the faster PIN photodiodes. Thus R(t) =APD( t)=PN (t)is used as the measure of the crystal transparency. The laser monitoring system [69] performing this task is brieﬂy outlined in
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||the next section. Because of the different optical paths and spectra of the injected laser pulses and the scin- tillation light, the changes in crystal transparency cause a change in response to the laser light which is not necessarily equal to the change in response to scintillation light. For attenuations <10% the – 113 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004 Figure 4.15: Relation between the transmission losses for scintillation light and for laser light for a given crystal.

An example of this relationship is given in ﬁgure 4.15. This power law describes well the behaviour of all the crystals that have been evaluated in the test beam, and this formula is expected to be valid in the barrel for both low and high luminosity at LHC. 4.9.1 Laser-monitoring system overview Figure 4.16 shows the basic components of the laser-monitoring system: two laser wavelengths are used for the basic source. One, blue, at l=440 nm, is very close to the scintillation emission peak, which is used to follow the changes in transparency due to radiation, and the other, near infra-red, at l=796 nm, is far from the emission peak, and very little affected by changes in transparency, which can be used to verify the stability of other elements in the system. The spectral contamination is less than 10 3. The lasers are operated such that the full width at half maximum of the pulses is 30 ns. The lasers can be pulsed at a rate of 80 Hz,
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||and the pulse timing jitter is less than 3 ns which allows adequate trigger synchronization with the LHC bunch train and ECAL ADC clock. – 114 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004 !"#$%&" !'"()*'"+,-.'../".0.-1"22$34! !'"5/"67."89 :";.)< "'6-=>6=-."?@A$"B=//5/("67."C)'.-" ',=->.")6"2D"9E"<.)/'"5/F.>65/("C)'.-"*=C'.'"5/"%G",+"67.")0)5C);C."()*'$"H 7."C)'.-"< ,/56,-5/(" '1'6.<"5/I.*./I./6C1"<.)'=-.'"67."5/F.>6.I"C5(76"+,-".)>7" *=C'."

The monitoring light pulses are distributed via a system of optical ﬁbres. A ﬁbre optic switch at the laser directs the laser pulses to 1 of 88 calorimeter regions (72 half supermodules in the barrel and 8 regions in each endcap). A two-stage distribution system mounted on each calorimeter region delivers the light to each crystal. To provide continuous monitoring, about 1% of the 3.17 ms beam gap in every 88.924 ms LHC beam cycle will be used to inject monitoring light pulses into crystals. The time needed to scan the entire ECAL is expected to be about 30 minutes. The ﬁrst laser system was installed in the CERN H4 test beam site in August 2001. The other two laser systems were installed at H4 in August, 2003.

The stochastic term There are three basic contributions to the stochastic term: 1. event-to-event ﬂuctuations in the lateral shower containment, – 117 – 2008 JINST 3 S080042. a photostatistics contribution of 2.1%, 3. ﬂuctuations in the energy deposited in the preshower absorber (where present) with respect to what is measured in the preshower silicon detector. The contribution to the stochastic term coming from ﬂuctuations in the lateral containment is expected to be about 1.5% when energy is reconstructed by summing an array of 5 5 crystals, and about 2% when using 3 3 crystals. The photostatistics contribution is given by: ape=s F Npe(4.3) where Npeis the number of primary photoelectrons released in the photodetector per GeV , and F is the excess noise factor which parametrizes ﬂuctuations in the gain process. This factor has a value close to 2 for the APDs, and is about 2.5 for the VPTs. A value of Npe4500 pe/GeV is found for the barrel, giving 2:1% for the photostatistics contribution to the stochastic term. In the endcap the photostatistics contribution is similar, since the larger collection area of the VPT largely compensates for the reduced quantum efﬁciency of the photocathode. The contribution to the energy resolution from the preshower device can be approximately parametrized as a stochastic term with a value of 5%/p E, where Eis in GeV . But, because it samples only the beginning of the shower, the resolution is, in fact, predicted to vary like s=Eµ 1=E0:75. A beam test in 1999 [105] veriﬁed this prediction. The
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||constant term The most important contributions to the constant term may be listed as follows: 1. non-uniformity of the longitudinal light collection, 2. intercalibration errors, 3. leakage of energy from the back of the crystal. The effects of the longitudinal light collection curve have been studied in detail. Quite stringent requirements are made on the crystal longitudinal uniformity. Requiring the constant term contri- bution due to non-uniformity be less than 0.3%, sets a limit on the slope of the longitudinal light collection curve in the region of the shower maximum of 0:35% per radiation length. A small increase in response towards the rear of the crystal helps to compensate the rear leakage from late developing showers, which would otherwise cause a low energy tail. The required response is achieved in the barrel by depolishing one long face of the crystals to a designated roughness. This surface treatment is incorporated into the crystal production process. The effect of rear leakage is very small. Charged particles leaking from the back of the crystals can also give a direct signal in the APDs (nuclear counter effect), but test beam data show that this effect is negligible for isolated electromagnetic showers: no tails on the high side of the energy distribution are observed even at the highest electron energy tested (280 GeV). – 118 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004The noise term There are three contributions to the noise term: 1. electronics noise, 2. digitization noise, 3. pileup noise. The signal amplitude in the test beam is reconstructed using a simple digital ﬁlter. The noise measured, after this amplitude reconstruction, for channels in barrel supermodules is  40 MeV/channel in the highest gain range. This noise includes both electronics and digitization noise. The amplitude reconstruction makes use of an event-by-event baseline subtraction using 3 digitization
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||samples taken directly before the signal pulse. This procedure removes the small channel-to-channel correlated noise. Its success is evidenced by the fact that, after this procedure, the noise in the sum of 25 channels is almost exactly 5 times the noise in a single channel [106]. In the endcap it is intended to sort the VPTs in bins of overall signal yield, which includes the photocathode area, the quantum efﬁciency and the VPT gain. The VPTs with higher overall signal yield are used for the larger radius regions of the endcap. This has the result that the transverse energy equivalent of the noise will be more or less constant, with a value of sET50 MeV . Neutron irradiation of the APDs in the barrel induces a leakage current which contributes to the electronics noise. The evolution of the leakage current and induced noise over the lifetime of the experiment has been extensively studied. The expected contribution is equivalent to 8 MeV/channel after one year of operation at L=1033cm 2s 1, and 30 MeV/channel at the end of the ﬁrst year of operation at L=1034cm 2s 1[69]. The shaped signals from the preampliﬁer output will extend over several LHC bunch cross- ings. When using a multi-weights method to reconstruct the signal amplitude [106], up to 8 time samples are used. Pileup noise will occur if additional particles reaching the calorimeter cause signals which overlap these samples. The magnitude of pileup noise expected at low luminosity (L = 21033cm 2s 1) has been studied using detailed simulation of minimum bias events generated between  5 and +3 bunch crossings before and after the signal. The average number of minimum bias events per bunch crossing was 3.5. Figure 4.20 shows the reconstructed amplitude observed with and without pileup in the absence of any signal. The fraction of events with a
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||signal beyond the Gaussian distribution of the electronics noise is small, showing that at low luminosity the pileup contribution to noise is small. Energy resolution in the test beam In 2004 a fully equipped barrel supermodule was tested in the CERN H4 beam. The energy res- olution measured with electron beams having momenta between 20 and 250 GeV/c conﬁrmed the expectations described above [107]. Since the electron shower energy contained in a ﬁnite crystal matrix depends on the particle impact position with respect to the matrix boundaries, the intrinsic performance of the calorimeter was studied by using events where the electron was limited to a 44 mm2region around the point of maximum containment (central impact ).

The energy is reconstructed by summing 3 3 crystals. A typical energy resolution was found to be: s E2 =2:8%p E2 +0:12 E2 + (0:30%)2; where Eis in GeV . This result is in agreement with the expected contributions detailed in the earlier part of this section. (Results from beam-test runs taken in 2006, using the ﬁnal VFE card, show a 10% improvement of the noise performance.) The energy resolution was also measured with no restriction on the lateral position of the in- cident electrons except that provided by the 20 20 mm2trigger. The trigger was roughly centred (3 mm) on the point of maximum response of a crystals. In this

For energy reconstruction in either a 3 3 or a 55 matrix an energy resolution of better than 0.45% is found for 120 GeV electrons after correction for containment. Figure 4.21 shows an example of the energy distributions before and after correction for the case of reconstruction in a 5 5 matrix, where the correction is smaller than for the 3 3 case. The energy resolution has also been measured for a series of 25 runs where the beam was directed at locations uniformly covering a 3 3 array of crystals. In this case a resolution of 0.5% was measured for 120 GeV electrons. – 120 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004 Energy (GeV)114 116 118 120 122 124Number of events 0100020003000400050006000Fit results: m = 120.0 GeV = 0.53 GeV! / m = 0.44 %!Without correction With correction 5 crystals×5Figure 4.21: Distribution of energy reconstructed in a 5 5 matrix, before and after correction for containment, when 120 GeV electrons are incident over a 20 20mm2area. – 121 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004Chapter 5 Hadron calorimeter The CMS detector is designed to study a wide range of high-energy processes involving diverse signatures of ﬁnal states. The hadron calorimeters are particularly important for the measurement of hadron jets and neutrinos or exotic particles resulting in apparent missing transverse energy [1]. Figure 5.1 shows the longitudinal view of the CMS detector. The dashed lines are at ﬁxed h values. The hadron calorimeter barrel and endcaps sit behind the tracker and the electromagnetic calorimeter as seen from the interaction point. The hadron calorimeter barrel is radially
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||restricted between the outer extent of the electromagnetic calorimeter (R = 1.77 m) and the inner extent of the magnet coil (R = 2.95 m). This constrains the total amount of material which can be put in to absorb the hadronic shower. Therefore, an outer hadron calorimeter or tail catcher is placed outside the solenoid complementing the barrel calorimeter. Beyond jhj=3, the forward hadron calorimeters placed at 11.2 m from the interaction point extend the pseudorapidity coverage down tojhj=5:2 using a Cherenkov-based, radiation-hard technology. The following sections describe these subdetectors in detail. 5.1 Barrel design (HB) The HB is a sampling calorimeter covering the pseudorapidity range jhj<1:3. The HB is divided into two half-barrel sections (ﬁgure 5.2), each half-section being inserted from either end of the barrel cryostat of the superconducting solenoid and subsequently hung from rails in the median plane. Since the HB is very rigid compared to the cryostat, great care has been taken to ensure that the barrel load is distributed evenly along the rails [108]. Absorber geometry The HB consists of 36 identical azimuthal wedges which form the two half-barrels (HB+ and HB–). The wedges are constructed out of ﬂat brass absorber plates (table 5.1) aligned parallel to the beam axis. The numbering scheme of the wedges is shown in ﬁgure 5.3. Each wedge is segmented into four azimuthal angle (f ) sectors. The plates are bolted together in a staggered geometry resulting in a conﬁguration that contains no projective dead material for the full radial extent of a wedge (ﬁgure 5.4). The innermost and outermost plates are made of stainless steel for structural strength. The plastic scintillator is divided into 16 hsectors, resulting in a segmentation – 122 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004 HFHEHBHOFigure 5.1: Longitudinal view of the CMS detector showing the locations of

The wedges are themselves bolted together, in such a fashion as to minimize the crack between the wedges to less than 2 mm. The absorber (table 5.2) consists of a 40-mm-thick front steel plate, followed by eight 50.5- mm-thick brass plates, six 56.5-mm-thick brass plates, and a 75-mm-thick steel back plate. The total absorber thickness at 90is 5.82 interaction lengths (l I). The HB effective thickness increases with polar angle (q ) as 1= sinq, resulting in 10.6 lIatjhj=1:3. The electromagnetic crystal calorimeter [69] in front of HB adds about 1.1 lIof material. Scintillator The active medium uses the well known tile and wavelength shifting ﬁbre concept to bring out the light. The CMS hadron calorimeter consists of about 70 000 tiles. In order to limit the number of individual elements to be handled, the tiles of a given flayer are grouped into a single mechanical scintillator tray unit. Figure 5.5shows a typical tray. The tray geometry has allowed for construc- tion and testing of the scintillators remote from the experimental installation area. Furthermore, – 123 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004 Figure 5.2: Assembled HCAL half-barrel in SX5, the above ground assembly hall. individual scintillator trays may be replaced without disassembly of the absorber in the event of catastrophic damage. Each HB wedge has four fdivisions (f -index = 1–4). Trays with segmenta- tion of f-index 2 and 3 go into the center of a wedge while trays with segmentation of f-index 1 and 4 go into the edge slots in a

Wedge 1 is on the inside (+ xdirection) of the LHC ring. The HB baseline active material is 3.7-mm-thick Kuraray SCSN81 plastic scintillator, chosen for its long-term stability and moderate radiation hardness. The ﬁrst layer of scintillator (layer 0) is located in front of the steel support plate. It was originally foreseen to have a separate read- out [108] and is made of 9-mm-thick Bicron BC408. The scintillators are summarized in table 5.3. The purpose of layer zero is to sample hadronic showers developing in the inert material between the EB and HB. The larger thickness of layer 16 serves to correct for late developing showers leaking out the back of HB. A tray is made of individual scintillators with edges painted white and wrapped in Tyvek 1073D which are attached to a 0.5-mm-thick plastic substrate with plastic rivets. Light from each tile is collected with a 0.94-mm-diameter green double-cladded wavelength-shifting ﬁbre (Kuraray Y-11) placed in a machined groove in the scintillator. For calibration purposes, each tray has 1-mm- diameter stainless steel tubes, called source tubes, that carry Cs137(or optionally Co60) radioactive sources through the center of each tile. An additional quartz ﬁbre is used to inject ultraviolet (337 nm) laser light into the layer 9 tiles. The top of the tray is covered with 2-mm-thick white polystyrene. The cover is grooved to provide routing paths for ﬁbres to the outside of the tray and – 125 – 2008 JINST 3

After exiting the scintillator, the wavelength shifting ﬁbres (WLS) are spliced to clear ﬁbres (Kuraray double-clad). The clear ﬁbre goes to an optical connector at the end of the tray. An optical cable takes the light to an optical decoding unit (ODU). The ODU arranges the ﬁbres into read-out towers and brings the light to a hybrid photodiode (HPD) [109]. An additional ﬁbre enters each – 126 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004 Figure 5.6: Cross-sectional view of a scintillator tray.

A schematic of the ﬁbre optics is shown in ﬁgure 5.7and the actual cabling is shown in ﬁgure 5.8. The HPD consists of a photocathode held at a HV of  8 kV at a distance of approximately 3.3 mm from a pixelated silicon photodiode. The ionization produced by the accelerated photo- electron in the diode results in a gain of the HPD of approximately 2000. There are 19 hexagonal 20-mm2pixels in a single HPD, the centermost of which is not read-out. A cross sectional view of an HPD is shown in ﬁgure 5.9. During the production and assembly process, the WLS ﬁbres are cut, polished, and mirrored. The reﬂectivity of the mirror is checked by measuring test ﬁbres which are mirrored along with the ﬁbres used in the calorimeter. Measuring the reﬂectivity of the mirror is done with a computer controlled UV scanner with the ﬁbres read out by
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||photodiodes. Clear ﬁbres are spliced onto WLS ﬁbres with a fusion splicer. The transmission across the splice is checked by splicing a sample of WLS ﬁbres onto WLS ﬁbres. The splice region is measured with the UV scanner. The transmission across the splice is 92.6% with an RMS of 1.8%. Next, the optical ﬁbres are glued into a 10 ﬁbre connector. This conﬁguration is called a pigtail. In order to get the ﬁbre lengths correct, the pigtail is assembled in a template. The connector is diamond polished. The ﬁbres are measured with the – 127 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004 Figure 5.7: Schematic of the HB optics. UV scanner. The scanner checks the green ﬁbre, clear ﬁbre, splice, and mirror. The RMS of the light from the ﬁbres is 1.9%. After the pigtail is inserted into the tray, the completed tray is checked with an automated source scanner using a Cs137source inside a lead collimator. This yields a 4 cm diameter source spot on the tray. The collimator is moved with a computer controlled x-y motor. From the scanner we determine the relative light yield of each tile and the uniformity of each tray. The light yield of the individual tiles has an RMS of 4.6%, while the transverse uniformity of the tile is 4.5%. A Cs137wire source is run through the 4 source tubes and the light yield is measured. The RMS of the ratio of collimated source to wire source is 1.3%. This means the line sources, which can be used when the calorimeter is completely assembled, can calibrate individual tiles to better than 2%. In addition to the moving wire source, there are laser and LED light injection systems. Longitudinal segmentation Thehtowers 1–14 have a single longitudinal read-out.

The front segment of tower 15 contains either 12 or 13 scintillators, due to the placement of the read-out box and the staggering of the layers (layers 0–11 for the middle two fsectors and 0–12 layers for the outer two fsectors). The rear segment of tower 15 has three scintillators. Tower 16, which is in front of the endcap (HE) has one scintillators in the front segment and seven in the rear.

The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||Endcap design (HE) The hadron calorimeter endcaps (HE) [108] cover a substantial portion of the rapidity range, 1:3<jhj<3 (13.2% of the solid angle), a region containing about 34% of the particles produced in the ﬁnal state. The high luminosity of the LHC (1034cm 2s 1) requires HE to handle high (MHz) counting rates and have high radiation tolerance (10 MRad after 10 years of operation at design luminosity) atjhj'3. Since the calorimeter is inserted into the ends of a 4-T solenoidal magnet, the absorber must be made from a non-magnetic material. It must also have a maximum number of interaction lengths to contain hadronic showers, good mechanical properties and reasonable cost, leading to the choice of C26000 cartridge brass. The endcaps are attached to the muon endcap yoke as shown in ﬁgures 5.11 and5.12. Only a small part of the calorimeter structure can be used for the ﬁxation to the magnet iron, because the majority of the space between HE and muon absorber is occupied with muon cathode strip chambers. A 10-t electromagnetic calorimeter (EE) with a 2-t preshower detector (ES) is attached at the front face of HE. The large weight involved (about 300 t) and a strict requirement to minimize non-instrumented materials along particle trajectories, has made the design of HE a challenge to engineers. An interface kinematic scheme was devel- oped in order to provide precise positioning of the endcap detectors with respect to the adjacent muon station, and to minimize the inﬂuence of deformation under magnetic forces. The interface kinematic contains a sliding joint between the interface tube, and HE back-ﬂange and the hinge connection between brackets and the iron disk (YE1). Structural materials used in the interface system are non-magnetic in order not to distort the axial magnetic ﬁeld of up to 4 T. – 131 –

Scintillator trays can be seen to be inserted in some of the outer sectors. Absorber geometry The design of the absorber is driven by the need to minimize the cracks between HB and HE, rather than single-particle energy resolution, since the resolution of jets in HE will be limited by pileup, magnetic ﬁeld effects, and parton fragmentation [110, 111]. The plates are bolted together in a staggered geometry resulting in a conﬁguration that contains no projective “dead” material (ﬁgure 5.13). The design provides a self-supporting hermetic construction. The brass plates are 79-mm-thick with 9-mm gaps to accommodate the scintillators. The total length of the calorimeter, including electromagnetic crystals, is about 10 interaction lengths (l I). The outer layers of HE have a cutout region for installation of the photodetectors and front- end electronics. To compensate for the resulting reduction of material, an extra layer (  1) is added to tower 18 [112]. The outer layers are ﬁxed to a 10-cm-thick stainless steel support plate. The optical elements are inserted into the gaps after the absorber is completely assembled; therefore, the optical elements must have a rigid structure to allow insertion from any position. Scintillator trays The scintillation light is collected by wavelength shifting (WLS) ﬁbres [113, 114]. The design minimizes dead zones because the absorber can be made as a solid piece without supporting structures while at the same time the light can be easily routed to the photodetectors.

The ends of the ﬁbres are machined with a diamond ﬂy cutter and one end is covered with aluminium to increase the light collection. The other end is spliced to a clear ﬁbre, which is terminated in an optical connector. The connector with the glued ﬁbres is also machined by a diamond ﬂy cutter. The scintillator is painted along the narrow edges and put into a frame to form a tray. The total number of tiles for both HE calorimeters is 20 916 and the number of trays is 1368. The design of a tray is presented in ﬁgure 5.15. The numbering scheme in his shown in ﬁgure 5.16, and the CMS convention for f as applied to HE is shown in ﬁgure 5.17. The scintillators are wrapped with Tyvek and sandwiched between sheets of duraluminum. The stack contains holes for ﬁbres which are terminated with optical connectors. The gap between the duraluminum plates is ﬁxed by brass spacers screwed together. The granularity of the calorimeters is DhDf=0:0870:087 forjhj<1:6 and DhDf0:170:17 forjhj1:6. The tray design is very robust and reliable. The trays are relatively stiff which is very im- portant for insertion into the absorber. To control the scintillator tray quality, a UV nitrogen laser was used to excite the scintillators. The light is fed by quartz ﬁbres to the connector and is fanned out as shown in ﬁgure 5.15. These ﬁbres are terminated with aluminium reﬂectors and distribute the light to all tiles. The light signal produced by a UV ﬂash in the scintillator is similar to the signal induced by a charged particle. This allows a performance check of the entire optical route from scintillator to electronics, providing an important technique to track possible degradation of transparency due to radiation damage.

The trays are inserted into the gaps in the absorber and ﬁxed by screws. At the back of the calorimeter, boxes with photodetectors and electronics are located in the notch shown in ﬁgure 5.18. Optical cables transfer signals from the scintillator trays to the photodetectors. The partially assem- bled HE is shown in ﬁgure 5.12. Multipixel hybrid photodiodes (HPDs) are used as photodetectors due to their low sensitivity to magnetic ﬁelds and their large dynamical range. – 133 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004 Figure 5.14: a) Basic structure of a scintillator tile with a groove to ﬁx wavelength shifting ﬁbre, b) cross section of the 3.7-mm-thick scintillator for layers 1–17, and c) cross section of the 9-mm- thick scintillator for layer zero. Two layers of reﬂecting paint cover the side surfaces of the tile. Longitudinal segmentation The longitudinal segmentation of HE (ﬁgure 5.10) is, in part, motivated by the radiation environ- ment. Correction of the calibration coefﬁcients after scintillator degradation can be applied, in order to restore the energy resolution. The towers nearest the beam line (27 and 28 plus guard ring “29”) have 3 divisions in depth which are read-out separately. The other towers (except 16 and 17 which overlap with the electromagnetic barrel calorimeter) have two longitudinal readouts for potential use during the time period when the electromagnetic endcap calorimeter (EE) may not yet be available. A special scintillator layer of 9 mm BC408 (layer 0) is installed in front of the absorber to partially correct for the different response of EE to electrons and hadrons and for particle absorption in the mechanical structure supporting EE. – 134 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004 Figure 5.15: The design of

To ensure adequate sampling depth for jhj<1:3, the hadron calorimeter is extended outside the solenoid with a tail catcher called the HO or outer calorimeter. The HO utilises the solenoid coil as an additional absorber equal to 1.4/sinq interaction lengths and is used to identify late starting showers and to measure the shower energy deposited after HB. Outside the vacuum tank of the solenoid, the magnetic ﬁeld is returned through an iron yoke designed in the form of ﬁve 2.536 m wide (along z-axis) rings. The HO is placed as the ﬁrst sensitive layer in each of these ﬁve rings. The rings are identiﬁed by the numbers  2, 1, 0, +1,+2. The numbering increases with zand the nominal central zpositions of the ﬁve rings are respectively 5.342 m, 2.686 m, 0, +2.686 m and +5.342 m. At h=0, HB has the minimal absorber depth. Therefore, the central ring
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||(ring 0) has two layers of HO scintillators on either side of a 19.5 cm thick piece of iron (the tail catcher iron) at radial distances of 3.82 m and 4.07 m, respectively. All other rings have a single HO layer at a radial distance of 4.07 m. The total depth of the calorimeter system is thus extended to a minimum of 11.8 lIexcept at the barrel-endcap boundary region. The HO is constrained by the geometry of the muon system. Figure 5.19 shows the position of HO layers in the rings of the muon stations in the overall CMS setup. The segmentation of these detectors closely follows that of the barrel muon system. Each ring has 12 identical f-sectors. The 12 sectors are separated by 75-mm-thick stainless steel beams which hold successive layers of iron of the return yoke as well as the muon system. The space between successive muon rings in thehdirection and also the space occupied by the stainless steel beams in the fdirection are not available for HO. In addition, the space occupied by the cryogenic “chimneys” in sector 3 of ring  1, and sector 4 of ring +1 are also not available for HO. The chimneys are used for the cryogenic transfer lines and power cables of the magnet system. Finally, the mechanical structures needed to position the scintillator trays further constrain HO along f. – 138 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004In the radial direction each HO layer has been allocated a total of 40 mm, of which only 16 mm is available for the detector layer, the rest being used for the aluminium honeycomb support structures. In addition, the HO modules are independently supported from the steel beams located on either side of each fsector. The thickness and position of the iron ribs in the

The sizes and positions of the tiles in HO are supposed to roughly map the layers of HB to make towers of granularity 0.087 0.087 in handf. The HO consists of one (rings 1 and 2) or two (ring 0) layers of scintillator tiles located in front of the ﬁrst layer of the barrel muon detector. Scintillation light from the tiles is collected using multi-clad Y11 Kuraray wavelength shifting (WLS) ﬁbres of diameter 0.94 mm, and transported to the photo detectors located on the structure of the return yoke by splicing a multi-clad Kuraray clear ﬁbre (also of 0.94 mm diameter) with the WLS ﬁbre. In order to simplify installation of HO, the scintillator tiles are packed into a single unit called a tray. Each tray corresponds to one fslice (5wide in f). However, along the z (h) direction, a tray covers the entire span of a muon ring. Figure 5.20 shows a schematic view of a HO tray where one tile is mapped to a tower of HB and the optical cable from the tray is connected to the read-out box. The physics impact of HO has been studied [115] using a simulation of the CMS detector. Single pions of ﬁxed energies are shot at speciﬁc hvalues and the resulting energy deposits in the electromagnetic calorimeter and in the layers of the hadron calorimeter are combined to measure the energy. Figure 5.21 shows distributions of the measured energy scaled to the incident energy for 200 GeV pions at h= 0 and 225 GeV at h= 0.5 (pointing towards the middle of ring 1). The solid and dashed lines in the ﬁgure indicate measurements without and with HO, respectively. As can be seen in ﬁgure 5.21, there is an

The measurements with HO are more Gaussian in nature indicating that the addition of HO recovers the effect of leakage. The effect of leakage is visible at h= 0 (ring 0) from 70 GeV , increasing with energy. The mean fraction of energy in HO increases from 0.38% for 10 GeV pions to 4.3% for 300 GeV pions. There is some evidence of leakage without HO in ring 1 but it is reduced due to the greater HB thickness at larger jhj. The amount of leakage in ring 2 is found to be negligible at energies below 300 GeV . The effect of shower leakage has a direct consequence on the measurement of missing trans- verse energy (Emiss T). Study of QCD events shows that the cross section for those events, where at least one particle has ETabove 500 GeV , is several pb. For these events the HO is useful to decrease the leakage and improve the Emiss Tmeasurement. Figure 5.22 shows the dijet integrated cross section for Emiss Tabove a certain value. It is clear from the ﬁgure that the inclusion of HO reduces the dijet rate by a factor of 1.5 or more for moderate Emiss Tvalues, a region important for searches of supersymmetric particles. Module speciﬁcation HO is physically divided into 5 rings in hconforming to the muon ring structure. The rings are numbered 2, 1, 0, +1 and +2 with increasing h. Each ring of the HO is divided into 12 identical fsectors and each sector has 6 slices (numbered 1 to 6 counting clockwise) in f. The fslices of a layer are identical in all sectors.

The shorter trays are constructed without the tile corresponding to tower number 5.

The WLS ﬁbres are held inside the tile in grooves with a key hole cross section. Each groove has a circular part (of diameter 1.35 mm) inside the scintillator and a neck of 0.86 mm width. The grooves are 2.05-mm deep. Each tile has 4 identical grooves, one groove in each quadrant of the tile. The grooves closely follow the quadrant boundary. The corners of the grooves are rounded to prevent damage to the ﬁbre at the bend and to ease ﬁbre insertion. The groove design is slightly different for the tile where the optical connector is placed at the end of the tray. Since the tiles are large, 4 grooves ensure good light collection and less attenuation of light. The HO has 95 different tile dimensions, 75 for layer 1 and 20 for layer 0. The total number of tiles is 2730 (2154 for layer 1 and 576 for layer 0). Trays All tiles in each fslice of a sector are grouped together in the form of a tray. Each tray contains 5 tiles in rings2; 6 tiles in rings 1 and 8 tiles in ring 0. The edges of the tiles are painted with Bicron reﬂecting white paint for better light collection as well as isolating the individual tiles of a tray.

The top plastic cover is 2-mm-thick and the bottom one is 1-mm-thick. Figure 5.25 shows a cross section of a tray to illustrate the different components. The plastic covers (top and bottom) have holes matching with the holes in the tiles. Specially designed countersunk screws passing through these holes ﬁx the plastic covers ﬁrmly on the tiles.

A 1.5-mm-wide straight groove runs along the edge of the top cover to accommodate a stainless steel tube. This is used for the passage of a radioactive source which is employed in calibrating the modules. Each connector has two holes and they are ﬁxed to the scintillator-plastic assembly through matching holes. Each fsector in each ring has 6 trays.

The other end of the WLS ﬁbre comes out of the tile through a slot made on the 2-mm-thick black plastic cover sheet. To minimise the loss of light in transportation, the WLS ﬁbre (attenuation length of 1.8 m) is spliced to a clear ﬁbre (attenuation length of 8.0 m). A ﬁbre is spliced only if the potential WLS light loss is larger than the light loss at a spliced joint. Thus depending on tile length (along h) 2–3 ﬁbres in each pigtail are made only of WLS ﬁbres. The clear ﬁbres from each tile follow the guiding grooves on the top plastic to the optical connector at the end. Each tray has two optical connectors mounted on one end of the tray. In a tray, the grooves of the tiles form two rows along h. The ﬁbres from all grooves on one row terminate on one connector (ﬁgure 5.26). The number of ﬁbres from trays in different rings are given in table 5.7. The bunch of ﬁbres ﬁxed to the optical connector is called a pigtail (ﬁgure 5.27). Each tray has 2 pigtails and there are 864 pigtails in total: 720 for layer 1 and 144 for layer 0.

The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||The forward calorimeter will experience unprecedented particle ﬂuxes. On average, 760 GeV per proton-proton interaction is deposited into the two forward calorimeters, compared to only 100 GeV for the rest of the detector. Moreover, this energy is not uniformly distributed but has a pronounced maximum at the highest rapidities. At jhj=5 after an integrated luminosity of 5 105pb 1(10 years of LHC operation), the HF will experience 10 MGy. The charged hadron rates will also be extremely high. For the same integrated luminosity, inside the HF absorber at 125 cm from the beam-line, the rate will exceed 1011per cm2[108]. This hostile environment presents a consider- able challenge to calorimetry, and the design of the HF calorimeter was ﬁrst and foremost guided by the necessity to survive in these harsh conditions, preferably for at least a decade. Successful operation critically depends on the radiation hardness of the active material. This was the principal reason why quartz ﬁbres (fused-silica core and polymer hard-cladding) were chosen as the active medium. The signal is generated when charged shower particles above the Cherenkov threshold (E  190 keV for electrons) generate Cherenkov light, thereby rendering the calorimeter mostly sensitive to the electromagnetic component of showers [116]. A small fraction of the generated light is captured, ftrap=NA=2n2 core, where NA is the numerical aperture (NA =0:330:02) and ncore is the refractive index of the quartz core. Only light that hits the core-cladding interface at an angle larger than the critical angle (71) contributes to the calorimeter signal. The half-angle q= 19is determined by the refractive indices of the core (n core) and the cladding (n clad), sin q=q n2core n2 clad. The ﬁbres measure 600 10mm in diameter for the fused-silica core, 630+5  10mm with the polymer hard-cladding, and 800 30mm with the protective acrylate buffer. Over 1000

The attenuation length of these ﬁbres is measured to be 15 m using high energy electrons at 90to the ﬁbres. – 145 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004The optical attenuation at a wavelength lin these types of ﬁbres scales as a(l)(D=D 0)b(l) where Dis the accumulated dose, which is normalized to a reference dose (D 0=1 MGy) for con- venience. For example, at a wavelength l=450 nm at the accumulated dose of D=1 MGy, the induced attenuation is 1:5 dB/m, thus deﬁning a. The aandbparameters characterize the radi- ation hardness of a given ﬁbre. For high OH (300–500 ppm) HF ﬁbres at 450 nm, the measured values are a1:5 and b0:3 [117–119]. An accumulated dose of 10 MGy will result in a loss of optical transmission by a half, which is the worst case for HF after a decade. The calorimeter consists of a steel absorber structure that is composed of 5 mm thick grooved plates. Fibres are inserted in these grooves. The detector is functionally subdivided into two lon- gitudinal segments. Half of the ﬁbres run over the full depth of the absorber (165 cm 10l I) while the other half starts at a depth of 22 cm from the front of the detector. These two sets of ﬁbres are read out separately. This arrangement makes it possible to distinguish showers gener- ated by electrons and photons, which deposit a large fraction of their energy in the ﬁrst 22 cm, from those generated by hadrons, which produce nearly equal signals in both calorimeter seg- ments on average. The long ﬁbre section is referred as L(measuring the total signal), and the short ﬁbre section as S(measuring the energy deposition after 22 cm
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||of steel). The absorber has grooves (0: 90+0:12  0mm wide and 1: 06+0:6  0mm in depth) which make a square grid separated by 5: 00:1 mm center-to-center. Long and short ﬁbres alternate in these grooves. The pack- ing fraction by volume (ﬁbre/total) in the ﬁrst 22 cm is 0.57% and is twice as large beyond that depth. The forward calorimeter is essentially a cylindrical steel structure with an outer radius of 130.0 cm. The front face of the calorimeter is located at 11.2 m from the interaction point. The hole for the beam pipe is cylindrical, with radius 12.5 cm from the center of the beam line. This structure is azimuthally subdivided into 20modular wedges. Thirty-six such wedges (18 on either side of the interaction point) make up the HF calorimeters. A cross sectional view of the HF is shown in ﬁgure 5.28. The ﬁbres run parallel to the beam line, and are bundled to form 0.175 0.175 (DhDf)towers (ﬁgure 5.29 and table 5.8). The detector is housed in a hermetic radiation shielding which consists of layers of 40 cm thick steel, 40 cm of concrete, and 5 cm of polyethylene. A large plug structure in the back of the detector provides additional shielding. Bundled ﬁbres are held in ferrules which illuminate one end of the air-core light guides that penetrate through 42.5 cm of the shielding matrix (steel, lead, and polyethylene). This shielding is necessary to protect the photomultipliers and the front-end electronics housed in the read-out boxes. The air-core light guide consists of a hollow tube lined on the inside with highly reﬂective custom-made sheets. These metal-coated reﬂectors are designed to be very efﬁcient (> 90%) in the visible spectrum at the relevant angles ( 70 degrees from normal). Light typically makes ﬁve bounces before reaching the photocathode
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||and nearly half the light is lost in this transport. Each light guide is coupled to a standard bialkaline, 8-stage photomultiplier tube with a borosilicate glass window. A read-out box (RBX) houses 24 PMTs and services half of a wedge (10inf). The entire calorimeter system, with its shielding components, is mounted on a rigid table which supports more than 240 t with less than 1 mm deﬂection. The absorber alone weighs 108 t. The table is also designed for horizontal separation of the detector into two sections to clear the beam pipe at installation and removal. It is possible to align the forward calorimeters within 1 mm with respect to the rest of the CMS experiment. – 146 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004 Figure 5.28: The cross sectional view of the HF calorimeter shows that the sensitive area ex- tends from 125 to 1300 mm in the radial direction. The absorber in the beam direction measures 1650 mm. Bundled ﬁbres (shaded area) are routed from the back of the calorimeter to air-core light guides which penetrate through a steel-lead-polyethlene shielding matrix. Light is detected by PMTs housed in the read-out boxes. Stainless steel radioactive source tubes (red lines) are installed for each tower and are accessible from outside the detector for source calibration. The interaction point is at 11.2 meters from the front of the calorimeter to the right. All dimensions are in mm. The inner part of HF (4: 5<jhj<5) will experience radiation doses close to 100 Mrad/year, and large neutron ﬂuxes leading to activation of the absorber material, reaching several mSv/h in the region closest to the beam line after 60 days of running at 1034cm 2s 1luminosity and one day of cooling down. The active elements of HF (quartz ﬁbres) are sufﬁciently radiation-hard to survive these levels of radiation
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||with limited deterioration. The PMTs are shielded behind 40 cm of steel and borated polyethylene slabs. HF, using Cherenkov light from quartz ﬁbres, is practi- cally insensitive to neutrons and to low energy particles from the decay of activated radionucleids. Further shielding around HF achieves activation levels below 10 mSv/h on the periphery of the detector. A 10-cm-thick lead plate, located in front of HF during operations around the detector, reduces personal exposure to radiation from the absorber. Maintenance of read-out boxes will be performed with the help of semi-automatic extractor tools. HF is equipped with radiation monitors located at the periphery of the detector, and with a system (Raddam) to measure the transmission properties of a few reference quartz ﬁbres embedded in the absorber, as a function of integrated luminosity. – 147 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004 Figure 5.29: a) Transverse segmentation of the HF towers. b) An expanded view of the wedge shows the squared out groove holding the radioactive source tube.

The read-out consists of an optical to electrical transducer followed by a fast charge-integrating ADC. The digital output of the ADC is transmitted for every bunch over a gigabit digital optical ﬁbre to the service cavern, housing the off-detector electronics. In the service cavern, the signal is deserialized and used to construct trigger primitives which are sent to the calorimeter trigger. The data and trigger primitives are also pipelined for transmission to the DAQ upon a Level-1 Accept (L1A) decision. The optical signals from the scintillator-based detectors (HB/HE/HO) are converted to elec- trical signals using multichannel hybrid photodiodes (HPDs) which provide a gain of 2000. A detailed view of the scintillator-based front-end read-out chain is given in ﬁgure 5.31. The optical signals from individual sampling layers are brought out on clear ﬁbres. The ﬁbres correspond- ing to a projective calorimeter tower are mapping via an optical decoding unit (ODU) to a cookie that interfaces to individual pixels on the HPD. In the forward calorimeter, where the magnetic ﬁelds are much smaller than in the central detector, conventional photomultiplier tubes (Hama- matsu R7525HA) are used and quartz-ﬁbre bundles are routed directly
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||to the phototube windows. An overview of the HCAL controls is given in ﬁgure 5.32. Several PCs in the CMS control room operated through PVSS are used to control high and low voltages. The control system also downloads pedestal DAC and timing parameters to front-ends and controls many of the calibration and monitoring systems including the source calibration drivers, the LED pulsers, and the laser system. These systems record temperature, humidity and other constants useful for correlation studies of detector/calibration stability. The conﬁguration database contains the relationships or mapping for all HCAL detector com- ponents: wedges, layers, read-out boxes (RBX), cables, HCAL Trigger (HTR) cards, and calibra- – 149 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004 Figure 5.31: Overview of HCAL read-out/trigger chain and connections to database.

The condi- tions database has the slow-controls logging, the calibration constants (pedestals, gains, timing information, etc.) and the conﬁguration database downloaded to the read-out system during the initialization. The analogue signal from the HPD or photomultiplier is converted to a digital signal by a charge-integrating ADC ASIC called the QIE (Charge-Integrator and Encoder). The QIE internally contains four capacitors which are connected in turn to the input, one during each 25 ns period. The integrated charge from the capacitors is converted to a seven-bit non-linear scale to cover the – 150 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004 Figure 5.33: Contribution of the FADC quantization error to the resolution, compared with a representative HCAL resolution curve. large dynamic range of the detector. The ADC is designed so its contribution to the detector energy resolution over its multi-range operation is negligible, as shown in ﬁgure 5.33. The QIE input characteristics were chosen
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||from test beam data to optimize speed and noise performance. This resulted in a per channel RMS noise of 4600 electrons (0.7 fC) corresponding to about 180 MeV . The digital outputs of three QIE channels are combined with some monitoring information to create a 32-bit data word. The 32-bit data, at a rate of 40 MHz, is fed into the Gigabit Optical Link (GOL) chip and transmitted using 8b/10b encoding off the detector to the service cavern. In the service cavern, the data is received by the HCAL Trigger/Read-out (HTR) board. The HTR board contains the Level-1 pipeline and also constructs the trigger primitives for HCAL. These trigger primitives are sent to the Regional Calorimeter trigger via Serial Link Board mezzanine cards. The HTR board receives data for 48 channels (16 data ﬁbres) and may host up to six SLBs. When a L1A is received by the HTR through the TTC system, it prepares a packet of data for the DAQ including a programmable number of precision read-out values and trigger primitives around the triggered bunch crossing. For normal operations, the HTR will transmit 7 time samples for each non-zero channel and a single trigger primitive for every trigger tower. These packets of data, each covering 24 channels, are transmitted by LVDS to the HCAL Data Concentrator Card (DCC). The DCC is the HCAL Front-End Driver (FED) and concentrates the data from up to 360 channels for transmission into the DAQ. The Level-1 trigger primitives (TPG) are calculated in the HTR modules. The QIE data are linearized and converted to transverse energy with a single look up table. Two or more consecutive time samples are summed. A sum over depth is made for those towers having longitudinal segmen- tation. A ﬁnal look up table is used to compress the

This allows each channel’s integration phase to correct for differences in the time-of-ﬂight from the interaction region as well as differences in the optical pathlength within the detector. Figure 5.34 shows that scintillator tile signals produce relatively fast pulses such that 68% of the pulse is contained within a 25 ns window. Figure 5.35 shows the pulse shape for the for- ward calorimeter. The Cerenkov process and the phototubes used in the forward calorimeter are extremely fast, so the pulse in HF is only 10 ns wide. The HF is thus subject only to in-time pile-up which is important in the highly active forward region of CMS. An additional important effect on the HCAL pulse timing in HB/HE/HO comes from the input stage of the QIE. The QIE has an amplitude-dependent impedance which implies a faster pulse
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||shape for large signals than for small ones, as seen in ﬁgure 5.36. The amount of time slewing is dependent on the noise characteristics of the QIE, so the ﬁnal QIE ASICs for the barrel and endcap were chosen to limit the timeslew to the “medium” case in exchange for somewhat increased noise. In the outer calorimeter, the noise level is a critical factor for muon identiﬁcation and pile-up is much less important so the quieter “slow” characteristics were chosen for the HO QIEs. The in-situ synchronization of HCAL is performed using the HCAL laser system. The laser system consists of a single UV laser which can illuminate an entire half-barrel of HB or a single endcap at once through a series of optical splitters. The quartz ﬁbres which lead from the laser to the detector have been carefully controlled to equalize the optical path length to each wedge. The laser can be directed either straight onto a scintillator block connected to the HPD or into the – 152 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004 Figure 5.34: Measured single event pulse shape from the scintillator tiles, representative of HB/HE/HO pulse shapes. Figure 5.35: Measured pulse shape, energy collected vs. time, for HF. wedge. Within layer 9 of each wedge is an arrangement of optical ﬁbres which mimic the time-of- ﬂight from the interaction region. This arrangement allows the timing of HCAL to be ﬂattened and monitored, as has been demonstrated in test beam data taking, which veriﬁed the timing determined by the laser using the synchronized beam. In the HO and HF detectors, only the photodetector can be illuminated so the alignment will be based on construction and test beam data. – 153 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004 Particle energy (GeV)1 10210310Signal time delay (n s) 0246810121416Noise = 3800 e Noise

The channel-by-channel bunch synchronization of HCAL will be determined using a his- togramming procedure in the serial link boards (SLBs) which determine the bunch synchroniza- tion using the beam structure of the LHC. The event and bunch synchronization is monitored using fast control signals originating from the TTC system which are transmitted in the data stream be- tween the front-ends and the HTR. On a global scale, the bunch and event synchronization between the HCAL and other detector subsystems is determined using muons and other correlated physics signals. 5.6 HF luminosity monitor The CMS luminosity measurement will be used to monitor the LHC’s performance on a bunch-by- bunch basis in real time and to provide an overall normalization for physics analyses. The design goal for the real-time measurement is to determine the average luminosity with a 1% statistical accuracy with an update rate of 1 Hz. For ofﬂine analyses, the design goal is a systematic accuracy of 5%, although every reasonable effort will be made to produce a more accurate result. Both of these requirements must be met over a very large range of luminosities, extending from roughly 1028cm 2s 1to 1034cm 2s 1, and possibly beyond. A number of techniques capable of providing suitable luminosity information in real time have been identiﬁed [17]. One technique employs signals from the forward hadron calorimeter (HF) while another, called the Pixel Luminosity Telescope (PLT), uses a set of purpose-built parti- cle tracking telescopes based on single-crystal diamond pixel detectors. At the time of writing, the PLT has not been formally approved, but is under study. The methods based
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||on signals from the HF are the ones being most vigorously pursued. – 154 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004Two methods for extracting a real-time relative instantaneous luminosity with the HF have been studied. The ﬁrst method is based on zero counting in which the average fraction of empty towers is used to infer the mean number of interactions per bunch crossing. The second method exploits the linear relationship between the average transverse energy per tower and the luminosity. Outputs of the QIE chips used to digitize the signals from the HF PMTs on a bunch-by-bunch basis are routed to a set of 36 HCAL Trigger and Read-out (HTR) boards, each of which services 24 HF physical towers. In order to derive a luminosity signal from the HTR, an additional mezzanine board called the HF luminosity transmitter (HLX) is mounted on each of the HTR boards. The HLX taps into the raw HF data stream and collects channel occupancy and ET-sum data and transmits them to a central collector node over standard 100-Mbps Ethernet. The HLX boards have the same form factor as the Synchronization and Link Boards (SLBs) used to interface the ECAL and HCAL readouts to the Regional Calorimeter Trigger (RCT) system. Although all HF channels can be read by the HLX, MC studies indicate that the best linearity for occupancy histograms is obtained using just two hrings. Hence two sets of two rings are used for the occupancy histograms. Four rings are combined to form the ET-sum histogram. The algorithm has been optimized to minimize sensitivity to pedestal drifts, gain changes and other related effects. Each of the two sets of rings sends 12 bits of data to the HLX. There are three occupancy histograms dedicated to each of the following possible states for each tower: enabled- below-threshold,
The_CMS_Collaboration_2008_J._Inst._3_S08004.pdf|||over-threshold-1, over-threshold-2. In addition, a 15-bit ETsum value is sent to the HLX and a further histogram based on all 13 HF hrings is ﬁlled for use by the LHC. As a result, the input to the HLX is used to create eight histograms: two sets of three occupancy histograms, oneET-sum histogram, and one additional occupancy histogram. Each histogram has 3564 bins, one for each bunch in the LHC orbit. Each occupancy- histogram bin uses two bytes, and there are four bytes per bin in the ETsum histogram. The baseline design is to add the results from all desirable channels into a single set of histograms. The histograms are transmitted as UDP (User Datagram Protocol) packets from the HLX cards once roughly every 0.37 s, which is safely within the 1.45 s (worst case) histogram overﬂow time. The Ethernet core in the HLX automatically packages the data to make optimal use of net- work bandwidth. Each histogram spans several Ethernet packets, the precise number depending on the type of histogram. The eight sets of histograms comprise about 70 kB of data, which is transmitted at a rate of approximately 1.6 Mbps to an Ethernet switch that aggregates the data from multiple HLX boards. The switch multi-casts the data to a pair of luminosity server nodes. One of the servers is responsible for publishing the luminosity information to various clients, such as the CMS and LHC control rooms and the Fermilab Remote Operations Center (ROC). The second server archives the data for each luminosity section (one luminosity section corresponds to 220or- bits, or about 93 s). An XDAQ layer on this server makes it possible to communicate with other CMS DAQ systems. – 155 – 2008 JINST 3 S08004Chapter 6 Forward detectors 6.1 CASTOR The CASTOR (Centauro And Strange Object Research)

Its physics motivation is to complement the nucleus-nucleus physics pro- gramme [122], developed essentially in the baryon-free mid-rapidity region, and also the diffractive and low-x physics in pp collisions [123]. CASTOR will be installed at 14.38 m from the interaction point, covering the pseudorapidity range 5: 2<jhj<6:6. Figure 6.1 shows the location of CAS- TOR in the CMS forward region. The calorimeter will be constructed in two halves surrounding the beam pipe when closed, as shown in ﬁgure 6.2. The calorimeter and its readout are designed in such a way as to permit the observation of the cascade development of the impinging particles as they traverse the calorimeter. The typical total and electromagnetic energies in the CASTOR accep- tance range (about 180 TeV and 50 TeV , respectively, according to HIJING [121] Pb-Pb simulations at 5.5 TeV) can be measured with a resolution better than 1%. The main advantages of quartz calorimeters are radiation hardness, fast response and com- pact detector dimensions [124], making them suitable for the experimental conditions encountered in the very forward region at the LHC. The typical visible transverse sizes of hadronic and elec- tromagnetic showers in quartz calorimeters are 5–10 cm and about 10 mm respectively (for 95% signal containement), i.e. are a factor 3 to 4 times narrower than those in “standard” (scintillation) calorimeters [124].

Introduction The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics [1–4] has been tested by many experimentsover the last four decades and has been shown to successfully describe high energy particle interactions. However, the mecha- nism that breaks electroweak symmetry in the SM has not been veriﬁed experimentally. This mechanism [5– 10], which gives mass to massive elementary particles, impliesthe existence of a scalar particle, the SM Higgs boson. The search for the Higgs boson, the only ele- mentary particle in the SM that has not yet been ob- served,isoneofthehighlightsoftheLargeHadronCol- lider[11] (LHC)physicsprogramme. Indirectlimitsonthe SM Higgsbosonmassof mH< 158GeV at 95% conﬁdence level (CL) have been set using global ﬁts to precision electroweak results [12].

Both the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations reported excesses of events in their 2011 datasets of proton- proton ( pp) collisions at centre-of-mass energy√s= 7TeV at the LHC, which were compatible with SM Higgs boson production and decay in the mass region 124–126GeV,withsigniﬁcancesof2.9and3.1standarddeviations( σ), respectively[17, 18].

The kinematic region in which a SM Higgs boson with a mass between 110 GeV and 140 GeV is searched for was kept blinded during the analysis optimisation, until satisfactory agreement was found between the observed and predicted numbers of events in control samples dominated by the principal backgrounds. This Letter is organised as follows. The ATLAS de- tector is brieﬂy described in Section 2. The simula- tionsamples andthe signal predictionsare presentedin Section 3. The analyses of the H→ZZ(∗)→4ℓ,H→γγ andH→WW(∗)→eνµνchannels are described in Sec- tions 4–6, respectively. The statistical procedure used to analyse the results is summarised in Section 7. The systematic uncertainties which are correlated between datasetsandsearchchannelsaredescribedinSection8. The results of the combination of all channels are re- portedinSection 9,whileSection10providesthecon- clusions. 2. The ATLAS detector TheATLASdetector[19–21]isamultipurposeparti- cle physics apparatus with forward-backward symmet- ric cylindrical geometry. The inner tracking detector (ID) consists of a silicon pixel detector, a silicon mi- crostrip detector (SCT), and a straw-tube transition ra- diationtracker(TRT).TheIDissurroundedbyathinsu- perconductingsolenoid which providesa 2 T magnetic ﬁeld, and by high-granularity liquid-argon (LAr) sam- plingelectromagneticcalorimetry. Theelectromagnetic calorimeter is divided into a central barrel (pseudora- pidity2|η|<1.475) and end-cap regions on either end of the detector (1 .375<|η|<2.5 for the outer wheel and 2.5<|η|<3.2 for the inner wheel). In the region matched to the ID ( |η|<2.5), it is radially segmented intothreelayers. Theﬁrstlayerhasa ﬁnesegmentation 2ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate

Signal and background simulation samples The SM Higgs boson production processes con- sidered in this analysis are the dominant gluon fu- sion ( gg→H, denoted ggF), vector-boson fusion (qq′→qq′H, denoted VBF) and Higgs-strahlung (qq′→WH,ZH, denoted WH/ZH). The small con- tribution from the associated production with a ttpair (q¯q/gg→t¯tH, denoted t¯tH) is taken into account only inthe H→γγanalysis. For the ggF process, the signal cross section is com- puted at up to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in QCD [22–28]. Next-to-leading order (NLO) elec- troweak (EW) corrections are applied [29, 30], as well asQCDsoft-gluonre-summationsatuptonext-to-next- to-leading logarithm (NNLL) [31]. These calculations, which are described in Refs. [32–35], assume factori- sation between QCD and EW corrections. The trans- verse momentum, pT, spectrum of the Higgs boson in theggFprocessfollowsthe HqTcalculation[36],which includesQCD correctionsat NLO and QCD

For the VBF process, full QCD and EW correc- tionsuptoNLO[38–41]andapproximateNNLOQCD corrections [42] are used to calculate the cross sec- tion. Crosssectionsoftheassociated WH/ZHprocesses (VH) are calculated including QCD corrections up to NNLO [43–45] and EW corrections up to NLO [46]. 2 The cross sections for the t¯tHprocess are estimated up toNLOQCD [47–51]. Thetotal crosssectionsfor SM Higgsbosonproduc- tion at the LHC with mH=125GeV are predicted to be 17.5 pb for√s=7TeV and 22.3pb for√s= 8TeV[52, 53]. The branching ratios of the SM Higgs boson as a functionof mH, aswell astheiruncertainties,arecalcu- lated using the HDECAY [54] and PROPHECY4F [55, 56] programs and are taken from Refs. [52, 53].

The normalisations of the generated samples are obtained from the state of the art calculations described above. Several di ﬀerent programs are used to generate the hard-scattering pro- cesses. To generate parton showers and their hadroni- sation, and to simulate the underlying event [66–68], PYTHIA6 [69] (for 7TeV samples and 8TeV sam- ples produced with MadGraph [70, 71] or AcerMC) or PYTHIA8 [72] (for other 8TeV samples) are used. Al- ternatively, HERWIG [73] or SHERPA [74] are used to generate and hadronise parton showers, with the HERWIG underlyingeventsimulationperformedusing JIMMY [75]. When PYTHIA6 or HERWIG are used, TAUOLA [76]

Acceptances and e ﬃciencies are obtained mostly from full simulations of the ATLAS detector [81] us- ing Geant4 [82]. These simulations include a realistic modellingofthepile-upconditionsobservedinthedata. Correctionsobtainedfrommeasurementsindataareap- plied to account for small di ﬀerencesbetween data and simulation (e.g. large samples of W,ZandJ/ψdecays areusedtoderivescalefactorsforleptonreconstruction andidentiﬁcatione ﬃciencies). 4.H→ZZ(∗)→4ℓchannel The search for the SM Higgs boson through the decay H→ZZ(∗)→4ℓ, whereℓ=eorµ, pro- vides good sensitivity over a wide mass range (110- 600 GeV),largelyduetotheexcellentmomentumreso- lution of the ATLAS detector. This analysis searches for Higgs boson candidates by selecting two pairs of isolatedleptons,eachofwhichiscomprisedoftwolep- tons with the same ﬂavour and opposite charge. The expectedcrosssectiontimesbranchingratioforthepro- cess H→ZZ(∗)→4ℓwith mH=125 GeV is 2.2fbfor√s=7 TeVand2.8fbfor√s=8 TeV. The largest background comes from continuum (Z(∗)/γ∗)(Z(∗)/γ∗) production, referred to hereafter as ZZ(∗). For low masses there are also important back- ground contributions from Z+jets and t¯tproduction, where charged lepton candidates arise either from de- caysofhadronswith b-orc-quarkcontentorfrommis- identiﬁcationofjets. The7 TeVdatahavebeenre-analysedandcombined withthe8 TeVdata. Theanalysisisimprovedinseveral aspectswithrespecttoRef.[83]toenhancethesensitiv- ity to a low-mass Higgs boson. In particular, the kine- matic selections are revised, and the 8 TeV data anal- ysis beneﬁts from improvements in the electron recon- struction and identiﬁcation. The expected signal sig- niﬁcances for a Higgs boson with mH=125 GeV are 1.6σfor the 7 TeV data (to be compared with 1.25 σ inRef. [83])and2.1 σforthe8 TeVdata. 4.1. Event selection The data are selected using single-lepton or dilepton triggers. For the single-muon trigger, the pTthreshold is18 GeVforthe7 TeVdataand24 GeVforthe8 TeV 3 data,while forthe single-electrontriggerthetransverse energy, ET,thresholdvariesfrom20 GeVto22 GeVfor the 7 TeV data and is 24 GeV for the 8 TeV data. For the dielectron triggers, the thresholds are 12 GeV
1207.7214v2.pdf|||for both electrons. For the dimuon triggers, the thresholds for the 7 TeV data are 10 GeV for each muon, while forthe 8 TeVdata thethresholdsare 13 GeV. Anaddi- tional asymmetric dimuon trigger is used in the 8 TeV datawiththresholds18 GeVand8 GeVfortheleading andsub-leadingmuon,respectively. Muon candidates are formed by matching recon- structed ID tracks with either a complete track or a track-segmentreconstructedin the MS [84]. The muon acceptance is extended with respect to Ref. [83] us- ing tracks reconstructed in the forward region of the MS (2.5<|η|<2.7), which is outside the ID cov- erage. If both an ID and a complete MS track are present,thetwoindependentmomentummeasurements are combined; otherwise the information of the ID or the MS is used alone. Electron candidates must have a well-reconstructed ID track pointing to an electromag- netic calorimeter cluster and the cluster should satisfy a set of identiﬁcation criteria [85] that require the lon- gitudinal and transverse shower proﬁles to be consis- tent with those expected for electromagnetic showers. Tracks associated with electromagnetic clusters are ﬁt- ted using a Gaussian-Sum Filter [86], which allows for bremsstrahlungenergylosses tobetakenintoaccount. Each electron (muon) must satisfy pT>7 GeV (pT>6 GeV) and be measured in the pseudorapidity range|η|<2.47 (|η|<2.7). All possible quadruplet combinationswithsame-ﬂavouropposite-chargelepton pairsare then formed. The most energeticlepton in the quadruplet must satisfy pT>20 GeV, and the second (third) lepton in pTorder must satisfy pT>15 GeV (pT>10 GeV). At least one of the leptons must satisfy the single-lepton trigger or one pair must sat- isfy the dilepton trigger requirements. The leptons are required to be separated from each other by ∆R=/radicalbig (∆η)2+(∆φ)2>0.1 if they are of the same ﬂavour andby∆R>0.2otherwise.

Its invariant mass, denoted by m12, is required to be between 50 GeV and 106 GeV. The remaining same- ﬂavour, opposite-charge lepton pair is the sub-leading lepton pair. Its invariant mass, m34, is required to be in the range mmin<m34<115 GeV, where the value ofmmindepends on the reconstructed four-lepton in- variant mass, m4ℓ. The value of mminvaries monoton- ically from 17 .5 GeV at m4ℓ=120 GeV to 50 GeV atm4ℓ=190 GeV [87] and is constant above this value. All possible lepton pairs in the quadruplet that have the same ﬂavour and opposite charge must satisfy mℓℓ>5 GeV in order to reject backgrounds involving theproductionanddecayof J/ψmesons. Iftwoormore quadrupletssatisfytheaboveselection,theonewiththe highest value of m34is selected. Four di ﬀerent analysis sub-channels, 4 e, 2e2µ, 2µ2eand 4µ, arranged by the ﬂavourofthe leadingleptonpair,are deﬁned. Non-promptleptonsfromheavyﬂavourdecays,elec- trons from photon conversions and jets mis-identiﬁed as electrons have broader transverse impact parameter distributions than prompt leptons from Zboson decays and/or are non-isolated. Thus, the Z+jets and t¯tback- ground contributions are reduced by applying a cut on thetransverseimpactparametersigniﬁcance,deﬁnedas the transverse impact parameter divided by its uncer- tainty, d0/σd0. This is requiredto be less than 3.5 (6.5) formuons(electrons). Theelectronimpactparameteris aﬀected by bremsstrahlung and thus has a broader dis- tribution. In addition, leptons must satisfy isolation require- ments based on tracking and calorimetric information. The normalised track isolation discriminant is deﬁned as the sum of the transversemomentaof tracksinside a cone of size∆R=0.2 around the lepton direction, ex- cluding the lepton track, divided by the lepton pT. The tracks considered in the sum are those compatible with theleptonvertexandhave pT>0.4 GeV( pT>1 GeV) in the case of electron (muon) candidates. Each lepton is required to have a normalised track isolation smaller than

The normalised calorimetric isolation for electrons is computedas the sum of the ETof positive- energy topological clusters [88] with a reconstructed barycentrefallingwithinaconeofsize ∆R=0.2around the candidate electron cluster, divided by the electron ET.

The summed energy of the cells assignedtotheelectronclusterisexcluded,whileacor- rectionis appliedto accountforthe electronenergyde- posited outsidethe cluster. The ambientenergydeposi- 4 tion in the event from pile-up and the underlying event isaccountedforusingacalculationofthemediantrans- verseenergydensityfromlow- pTjets[89,90].

Muons are requiredto have a normalisedcalorimetricisolation lessthan0.30(0.15formuonswithoutanassociatedID track). For both the track- and calorimeter-basedisola- tion,anycontributionsarising fromotherleptonsofthe quadrupletare subtracted. Thecombinedsignalreconstructionandselectionef- ﬁciencies for a SM Higgs with mH=125 GeV for the 7 TeV (8 TeV) data are 37% (36%) for the 4 µchannel, 20%(22%)forthe2 e2µ/2µ2echannelsand15%(20%) forthe4 echannel. The 4ℓinvariant mass resolution is improved by ap- plyinga Z-massconstrainedkinematicﬁttotheleading leptonpair for m4ℓ<190 GeV and to bothlepton pairs for higher masses. The expected width of the recon- structed mass distribution is dominated by the experi- mental resolution for mH<350 GeV, and by the natu- ralwidthoftheHiggsbosonforhighermasses(30 GeV atmH=400 GeV).

Systematic uncertainties The uncertainties on the integrated luminosities are determined to be 1.8% for the 7 TeV data and 3.6% for the 8 TeV data using the techniques described in Ref.[92]. The uncertainties on the lepton reconstruction and identiﬁcation eﬃciencies and on the momentum scale and resolution are determined using samples of W, Zand J/ψdecays [84, 85]. The relative uncertainty on the signal acceptance due to the uncertainty on the muon reconstruction and identiﬁcation e ﬃciency is ±0.7% (±0.5%/±0.5%) for the 4 µ(2e2µ/2µ2e) chan- nel for m4ℓ=600 GeV and increases to ±0.9% (±0.8%/±0.5%) for m4ℓ=115 GeV. Similarly, the relative uncertainty on the signal acceptance due to the uncertainty on the electron reconstruction and identiﬁ- cation eﬃciency is±2.6% (±1.7%/±1.8%) for the 4 e (2e2µ/2µ2e) channel for m4ℓ=600 GeV and reaches ±8.0% (±2.3%/±7.6%) for m4ℓ=115 GeV. The un- certainty on the electron energy scale results in an un- certainty of±0.7% (±0.5%/±0.2%) on the mass scale of the m4ℓdistribution for the 4 e(2e2µ/2µ2e) channel. The impact of the uncertainties on the electron energyresolution and on the muon momentum resolution and scale arefoundto benegligible. The theoretical uncertaintiesassociated with the sig- nal are described in detail in Section 8. For the SM ZZ(∗)background,whichisestimatedfromMCsimula- tion, the uncertainty on the total yield due to the QCD scale uncertainty is ±5%, while

The dominant background is SM diphoton production ( γγ); contributions also come fromγ+jet and jet+jet production with one or two jets mis-identiﬁedasphotons( γjandj j)andfromtheDrell- Yanprocess. The7 TeVdatahavebeenre-analysedand the results combined with those from the 8TeV data. Among other changes to the analysis, a new category of events with two jets is introduced, which enhancesthe sensitivity to the VBF process. Higgs boson events produced by the VBF process have two forward jets, originating from the two scattered quarks, and tend to be devoidof jets in the central region. Overall,the sen- sitivityoftheanalysishasbeenimprovedbyabout20% withrespectto thatdescribedinRef.[95]. 5.1. Event selection The data used in this channel are selected using a diphoton trigger [96], which requires two clusters formed from energy depositions in the electromagnetic calorimeter. An ETthreshold of 20GeV is applied to each cluster for the 7TeV data, while for the 8 TeV datathethresholdsareincreasedto35GeVonthelead- ing (the highest ET) cluster and to 25GeV on the sub- leading (the next-highest ET) cluster. In addition, loose criteriaareappliedtotheshapesoftheclusterstomatch the expectations for electromagnetic showers initiated by photons.

Pho- ton candidates are reconstructed in the ﬁducial region |η|<2.37, excluding the calorimeter barrel /end-cap transitionregion1 .37≤|η|<1.52. Photonsthatconvert to electron-positron pairs in the ID material can have one or two reconstructedtracks matched to the clusters inthecalorimeter.

In orderto accountfor energylosses upstreamof the calorimeter and energy leakage outside of the cluster, MCsimulationresultsareusedtocalibratetheenergies ofthephotoncandidates;thereareseparatecalibrations for unconvertedand convertedcandidates. The calibra- tion is reﬁned by applying η-dependent correction fac- tors, which are of the order of ±1%, determined from measured Z→e+e−events. The leading (sub-leading) photon candidate is required to have ET>40 GeV (30GeV). Photon candidates are required to pass identiﬁcation criteria based on shower shapes in the electromagnetic calorimeter and on energy leakage into the hadronic calorimeter[97]. Forthe7 TeVdata,thisinformationis combined in a neural network, tuned to achieve a sim- ilar jet rejection as the cut-based selection described in Ref. [95], but with higher photon e ﬃciency. For the 8TeVdata,cut-basedcriteriaareusedtoensurereliable photon performance for recently-recorded data. This cut-based selection has been tuned to be robust against pile-up by relaxing requirements on shower shape cri- teria moresusceptible to pile-up, and tighteningothers. 7 The photon identiﬁcation e ﬃciencies, averaged over η, range from 85% to above 95% for the ETrange under consideration. To further suppress the jet background, an isolation requirement is applied. The isolation transverse en- ergy is deﬁned as the sum of the transverse energy of positive-energy topological clusters, as described in Section 4, within a cone of size ∆R=0.4 around the photon candidate, excluding the region within 0 .125× 0.175in∆η×∆φaroundthephotonbarycentre. Thedis- tributions of the isolation transverse energy in data and simulationhavebeenfoundtobeingoodagreementus- ing electrons from Z→e+e−events and photons from Z→ℓ+ℓ−γevents.

In addition, for the 7TeV data analysis, the reconstructed conver- sion vertex is used in the likelihood for converted pho- tons with tracks containing hits in the silicon layers of the ID. The calorimeter pointing is su ﬃcient to ensure that the contribution of the opening angle between the photons to the mass resolution is negligible. Using the calorimeterpointingalone,theresolutionofthevertex z coordinateis∼15mm, improvingto ∼6mm for events withtworeconstructedconvertedphotons. Thetracking information from the ID improves the identiﬁcation of the vertex of the hard interaction, which is needed for thejet selectionin the2-jetcategory.

ForjetsintheIDacceptance( |η|<2.5), the fraction of the sum of the pTof tracks, associated withthe jet andmatchedtotheselected primaryvertex, with respect to the sum of the pTof tracks associated with the jet (jet vertex fraction, JVF) is required to be at least 0.75. This requirement on the JVF reduces the numberofjetsfromproton-protoninteractionsnotasso- ciated with the primary vertex. Motivated by the VBF topology, three additional cuts are applied in the 2-jet selection: the diﬀerence of the pseudorapiditybetween the leading and sub-leading jets (tag jets) is requiredto be larger than 2 .8, the invariant mass of the tag jets has to be largerthan 400GeV, and the azimuthal angle dif- ferencebetweenthe diphotonsystem andthe system of the tag jets has to be larger than 2 .6. About 70% of the signal events in the 2-jet category come from the VBF process. The other nine categories are deﬁned as follows: eventswith two unconvertedphotonsare separatedinto unconverted central (|η|<0.75forbothcandidates)and unconverted rest (all other events), events with at least 3pTt=/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle(pγ1 T+pγ2 T)×(pγ1 T−pγ2 T)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle//vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglepγ1 T−pγ2 T/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle,where pγ1 Tandpγ2 T are thetransverse momenta of the two photons. 8 Table 4: Number of events in the data ( ND) and expected number of signalevents ( NS)for mH=126.5GeVfromthe H→γγanalysis, for each category in the mass range 100 −160 GeV.

MC studies show that signal events, particularly those producedvia VBF or associated pro- duction ( WH/ZHandt¯tH), have on average larger pTt than background events.

The crosssections multiplied by the branching ratio into two photons are given in Table 4 for mH=126.5 GeV. The number of signal events produced via the ggF process is rescaled to take into account the expected destructive interfer- encebetweenthe gg→γγcontinuumbackgroundand ggF [103], leadingto a reductionof the productionrate by 2−5% dependingon mHand the event category.

In the simulation, the shower shape distributions are shifted slightly to improve the agreement with the data [97], and the photon energy resolution is broad- ened (by approximately 1% in the barrel calorimeterand 1.2−2.1% in the end-cap regions) to account for small diﬀerences observed between Z→e+e−data and MC events.

The pre-selectedpa- rameterisation in each category with the best expected sensitivity for mH=125GeV is selected as the back- groundmodel. 9 The largest absolute signal yield as deﬁned above is taken as the systematic uncertainty on the background model.

Thistermincorporates the estimated potential bias, thus providinga conserva- tive estimate of the uncertainty due to the background modelling. 5.6. Systematic uncertainties Hereafter, in cases where two uncertainties are quoted, they refer to the 7TeV and 8 TeV data, respec- tively. The dominant experimental uncertainty on the signal yield (±8%,±11%) comes from the photon re- construction and identiﬁcation e ﬃciency, which is es- timated with data using electrons from Zdecays and photons from Z→ℓ+ℓ−γevents. Pile-up modelling also aﬀects the expected yields and contributes to the uncertainty (±4%). Further uncertainties on the sig- nal yield are related to the trigger ( ±1%), photonisola- tion (±0.4%,±0.5%) and luminosity ( ±1.8%,±3.6%). Uncertainties due to the modelling of the underlying event are±6% for VBF and±30% for other produc- tionprocessesinthe2-jetcategory. Uncertaintiesonthe predicted cross sections and branching ratio are sum- marisedin Section8. The uncertainty on the expected fractions of signal events in each category is described in the following. The uncertainty on the knowledge of the material in front of the calorimeter is used to derive the amount of possibleeventmigrationbetweentheconvertedandun- convertedcategories( ±4%). Theuncertaintyfrompile- up on the population of the converted and unconverted categoriesis±2%. The uncertainty from the jet energy scale (JES) amounts to up to ±19% for the 2-jet cate- gory,andupto±4%fortheothercategories. Uncertain- ties from the JVF modelling are ±12% (for the 8TeV data) for the 2-jet category, estimated from Z+2-jets events by comparingdata and MC. Di ﬀerent PDFs and scale variations in the HqTcalculations are used to de- rive possible event migration among categories ( ±9%) dueto themodellingoftheHiggsbosonkinematics.

Event selection For the 8 TeV H→WW(∗)→eνµνsearch, the data are selected using inclusive single-muon and single- electron triggers. Both triggers require an isolated lep- ton with pT>24GeV. Quality criteria are applied to suppress non-collision backgroundssuch as cosmic- ray muons, beam-related backgrounds, and noise in the calorimeters. The primary vertex selection fol- lows that described in Section 4. Candidates for the H→WW(∗)→eνµνsearch are pre-selected by requir- ing exactly two opposite-charge leptons of di ﬀerent ﬂavours, with pTthresholds of 25 GeV for the leadinglepton and 15 GeV for the sub-leading lepton.

Electroncandidatesareselectedusinga combinationof tracking and calorimetric information [85]; the criteria are optimised for background rejection, at the expense of some reduced e ﬃciency. Muon candidates are re- stricted to those with matching MS and ID tracks [84], and therefore are reconstructed over |η|<2.5. The isolation criteria require the scalar sums of the pTof charged particles and of calorimeter topological clus- ters within∆R=0.3 of the lepton direction (excluding theleptonitself)eachtobelessthan0.12-0.20timesthe lepton pT. The exact value di ﬀers between the criteria for tracks and calorimeter clusters, for both electrons and muons, and depends on the lepton pT.

Without accompanying jets, the signal originates almost entirely from the ggF process and the back- ground is dominated by WWevents. In contrast, when 11 producedinassociationwithtwoormorejets,thesignal contains a much larger contributionfrom the VBF pro- cess compared to the ggF process, and the background is dominated by ttproduction. Therefore, to maximise thesensitivitytoSMHiggsevents,furtherselectioncri- teriadependingonthejetmultiplicityareappliedtothe pre-selectedsample. Thedata aresubdividedinto0-jet, 1-jet and 2-jet search channels according to the num- ber of jets in the ﬁnal state, with the 2-jet channel also includinghigherjet multiplicities. Owingto spin correlationsin the WW(∗)system aris- ing from the spin-0 nature of the SM Higgs boson and the V-A structure of the Wboson decay vertex, the charged leptons tend to emerge from the primary ver- texpointinginthesamedirection[107].

In order to reject the backgroundfrom Z→ττ, theττinvariant mass, mττ, is computed under theassumptionsthatthereconstructedleptonsare τlep- ton decay products. In addition the neutrinos produced in these decays are assumed to be the only source of Emiss Tand to be collinear with the leptons[109].

These are required to be separated in rapidity by a dis- tance|∆yj j|>3.8 and to have an invariant mass, mj j, largerthan 500 GeV. Eventswith an additional jet with pT>20 GeV between the tag jets ( yj1<y<yj2) are rejected.A transverse mass variable, mT[110], is used to test forthepresenceofasignalforalljetmultiplicities.

The statistical analysis of thedata usesa ﬁt to the mTdistributioninthe signalre- gionafterthe∆φℓℓrequirement(seeSection6.4),which resultsin increasedsensitivity comparedto the analysis describedinRef. [111]. For a SM Higgs boson with mH=125GeV, the cross section times branching ratio to the eνµνﬁnal state is 88fb for√s=7TeV, increasing to 112 fb at√s=8TeV. The combined acceptancetimes e ﬃciency of the 8TeV 0-jet and1-jet selection relativeto the ggF production cross section times branching ratio is about 7.4%. Theacceptancetimese ﬃciencyofthe8TeV2-jet selection relative to the VBF production cross section times branching ratio is about 14%. Both of these ﬁg- ures are based on the number of events selected before the ﬁnal mTcriterion is applied (as described in Sec- tion6.4). 6.2.

Systematic uncertainties Thesystematicuncertaintiesthathavethelargestim- pact on the sensitivity of the search are the theoretical uncertainties associated with the signal. These are de- scribed in Section 9. The main experimentaluncertain- ties are associated with the JES, the jet energy resolu- tion (JER), pile-up, Emiss T, the b-tagging eﬃciency, the W+jets transfer factor, and the integrated luminosity. The largest uncertainties on the backgrounds include WWnormalisation and modelling, top normalisation, andWγ(∗)normalisation. The 2-jet systematic uncer- tainties are dominated by the statistical uncertainties in the data and the MC simulation, and are therefore not discussedfurther. Variations of the jet energy scale within the system- atic uncertainties can cause events to migrate between the jet bins. The uncertainty on the JES varies from ±2% to±9% as a function of jet pTandηfor jets with pT>25GeV and|η|<4.5[101]. The largestimpact of this uncertainty on the total signal (background) yieldamounts to 7% (4%) in the 0-jet

The un- certainty on the JER is estimated from in situmeasure- ments and it impacts mostly the 1-jet channel, where its eﬀect on the total signal and background yields is 4% and 2%, respectively. An additional contributionto theJESuncertaintyarisesfrompile-up,andisestimated to vary between±1% and±5% for multiple ppcolli- sions in the same bunch crossing and up to ±10% for neighbouringbunch crossings. This uncertainty a ﬀects mainly the 1-jet channel, where its impact on the sig- nal and background yields is 4% and 2%, respectively. JESandleptonmomentumscaleuncertaintiesareprop- agated to the Emiss Tmeasurement. Additional contri- butions to the Emiss Tuncertainties arise from jets with pT<20GeVandfromlow-energycalorimeterdeposits notassociatedwithreconstructedphysicsobjects[113]. The impact of the Emiss Tuncertainty on the total signal and backgroundyields is ∼3%. The eﬃciencyof the b- tagging algorithm is calibrated using samples contain- ing muons reconstructed in the vicinity of jets [114]. Theuncertaintyonthe b-jettaggingeﬃciencyvariesbe- tween±5% and±18% as a function of the jet pT, and its impact on the total backgroundyield is 10% for the 1-jet channel. The uncertainty in the W+jets transfer factor is dominated by di ﬀerences in jet properties be- tween dijet and W+jets events as observed in MC sim- ulations. The total uncertainty on this background is approximately±40%,resultinginanuncertaintyonthe total background yield of 5%. The uncertainty on the integratedluminosityis ±3.6%. A ﬁt to the distribution of mTis performed in or- der to obtain the signal yield for each mass hypoth- esis (see Section 6.4). Most theoretical and experi- mental uncertainties do not produce statistically signif- icant changes to the mTdistribution. The uncertainties that do produce signiﬁcant changes of the distribution ofmThave no appreciable e ﬀect on the ﬁnal results, with the exception of those associated with the WW background. In this case, an uncertainty is included to take into account di ﬀerences in the distribution of mT and normalisation observed between the MCFM [115],

The potential impact of interference between resonant (Higgs-mediated) and non-resonant gg→WW diagrams[116]for mT>mHwasinvestigatedandfound to be negligible. The e ﬀect of the WWnormalisation, modelling, and shape systematics on the total back- ground yield is 9% for the 0-jet channel and 19% for the 1-jet channel. The uncertainty on the shape of the total background is dominated by the uncertainties on the normalisations of the individual backgrounds. The main uncertainties on the top background in the 0-jet 14 analysis include those associated with interference ef- fectsbetween t¯tandsingletop,initialstateanﬁnalstate radiation, b-tagging, and JER. The impact on the total background yield in the 0-jet bin is 3%. For the 1-jet analysis, the impact of the top background on the to- tal yield is 14%.

The parameter of in- terest is the global signal strength factor µ, which acts as a scale factor on the total number of events pre- dicted by the Standard Model for the Higgs boson sig- nal. This factor is deﬁned such that µ=0 corresponds to the background-only hypothesis and µ=1 corre- spondsto the SM Higgs boson signal in addition to the background. Hypothesisedvaluesof µare testedwith a statisticλ(µ) basedontheproﬁlelikelihoodratio[122]. This test statistic extracts the information on the signal strengthfromafulllikelihoodﬁttothedata. Thelikeli- hood function includes all the parameters that describe thesystematicuncertaintiesandtheircorrelations. Exclusion limits are based on the CL sprescrip- tion [123]; a value of µis regarded as excluded at 95% CL when CL sis less than 5%. A SM Higgs bo- sonwithmass mHisconsideredexcludedat 95%conﬁ- dence level (CL) when µ=1 is excluded at that mass. The signiﬁcance of an excess in the data is ﬁrst quan- 15 tiﬁed with the local p0, the probability that the back- ground can produce a ﬂuctuation greater than or equal to the excess observed in data. The equivalent formu- lation in terms of number of standard deviations, Zl, is referred to as the local signiﬁcance. The global prob- ability for the most signiﬁcant excess to be observed anywherein a givensearchregionisestimated with the methoddescribed in Ref. [124]. The ratio of the global tothelocalprobabilities,thetrialsfactorusedtocorrec t forthe”lookelsewhere”e ﬀect,increaseswiththerange of Higgs boson mass hypotheses considered, the mass resolutionsofthechannelsinvolvedinthecombination, andthesigniﬁcanceoftheexcess. The statistical tests are performed in steps of values ofthehypothesisedHiggsbosonmass mH. Theasymp- totic approximation [122] upon which the results are based has been validated with the method described in Ref.[17]. The combination of individual search sub-channels for a speciﬁc Higgs boson decay, and the full combi- nation of all search channels, are based on the global signal strength factor µand on the identiﬁcation of the nuisance parameters that correspond to the cor-

The main uncorrelated systematic uncertainties are described in Sections 4–6 for the H→ZZ(∗)→4ℓ, H→γγand H→WW(∗)→ℓνℓνchannels and in Ref. [17] for the other channels. They include the background normalisations or background model parameters from control regions or sidebands, the Monte Carlo simulation statistical uncertainties and the theoretical uncertainties a ﬀecting the background processes. Themainsourcesofcorrelatedsystematic uncertain- tiesarethefollowing. 1.Integrated luminosity: The uncertainty on the integrated luminosity is considered as fully correlated among channels and amounts to ±3.9% for the 7TeV data [132, 133], except for the H→ZZ(∗)→4ℓand H→γγchannels which were re-analysed; the uncer- taintyis±1.8% [92]forthesechannels. Theuncertainty is±3.6%forthe8TeV data. 2.Electron and photon trigger identiﬁcation: The uncertaintiesinthetriggerandidentiﬁcatione ﬃciencies aretreatedasfullycorrelatedforelectronsandphotons.3.Electron and photon energy scales: The elec- tron and photon energy scales in the H→ZZ(∗)→4ℓ andH→γγchannels are described by ﬁve parameters, which providea detailed account of the sources of sys- tematic uncertainty. They are related to the calibration method, the presampler energy scale in the barrel and end-cap calorimeters, and the material description up- streamofthecalorimeters. 4.Muon reconstruction: The uncertainties a ﬀecting muonsareseparatedintothoserelatedtotheIDandMS, in order to obtain a better description of the correlated eﬀectsamongchannelsusingdi ﬀerentmuonidentiﬁca- tioncriteriaanddiﬀerentrangesofmuon pT. 5.Jet energy scale and missing transverse energy: The jet energy scale and jet energy resolution are af- fected by uncertainties which depend on the pT,η, and ﬂavourof the jet.

The QCD scale uncertainties for mH=125 GeV amount to +7% −8%fortheggFprocess, ±1%fortheVBF and WH/ZH processes, and+4% −9%for the t¯tHprocess [52, 53]; the small dependenceof these uncertaintieson mHis taken intoaccount.

The uncertainties related to thepartondistributionfunctionsamountto ±8%forthe predominantly gluon-initiated ggF and t¯tHprocesses, and±4% for the predominantly quark-initiated VBF andWH/ZHprocesses [78, 134–136]. The theoretical uncertainty associated with the exclusive Higgs boson production process with additional jets in the H→γγ, H→WW(∗)→ℓνℓνandH→τ+τ−channelsisestimated using the prescription of Refs. [53, 117, 118], with the noticeable diﬀerence that an explicit calculation of the gluon-fusion process at NLO using MCFM [137] in the 2-jet category reduces the uncertainty on this non-negligible contribution to 25%.

Resultsareshownseparately forthe√s=7TeVdata(dark,blue),the√s=8TeV data (light, red), and their combination (black). The largest local signiﬁcance for the combination of the 7 and 8 TeV data is found for a SM Higgs boson mass hypothesis of mH=126.5GeV, where it reaches 6.0σ, with an expected value in the presence of a SM Higgs boson signal at that mass of 4 .9σ(see also Ta- ble 7). For the 2012 data alone, the maximum lo- cal signiﬁcance for the H→ZZ(∗)→4ℓ,H→γγand H→WW(∗)→eνµνchannelscombinedis4.9 σ,andoc- cursat mH=126.5GeV (3.8σexpected).

Characterising the excess The mass of the observed new particle is esti- mated using the proﬁle likelihood ratio λ(mH) for H→ZZ(∗)→4ℓandH→γγ, the two channels with the highest mass resolution. The signal strength is al- lowed to vary independently in the two channels, al- though the result is essentially unchanged when re- stricted to the SM hypothesis µ=1. The leading sources of systematic uncertainty come from the elec- tron and photon energy scales and resolutions. The re- sulting estimate for the mass of the observedparticle is 126.0±0.4 (stat)±0.4 (sys)GeV. The best-ﬁt signal strength ˆ µis shownin Fig. 7(c) as a function of mH. The observed excess corresponds to ˆµ=1.4±0.3 for mH=126GeV, which is consistent with the SM Higgs boson hypothesis µ=1. A sum- mary of the individual and combined best-ﬁt values of the strength parameter for a SM Higgs boson mass hy- pothesis of 126GeV is shown in Fig. 10, while more information about the three main channels is provided inTable7. In order to test which values of the strength and mass of a signal hypothesis are simultaneously consis- tentwiththedata,theproﬁlelikelihoodratio λ(µ,mH)is used.

Conclusion Searches for the Standard Model Higgs boson have been performed in the H→ZZ(∗)→4ℓ,H→γγand H→WW(∗)→eνµνchannels with the ATLAS experi- mentattheLHCusing5.8–5.9fb−1ofppcollisiondata recordedduring April to June 2012 at a centre-of-mass energy of 8TeV. These results are combined with ear- lier results [17], which are based on an integrated lu- minosity of 4.6–4.8 fb−1recorded in 2011 at a centre- of-mass energy of 7TeV, except for the H→ZZ(∗)→4ℓ andH→γγchannels,whichhavebeenupdatedwiththe improvedanalysespresentedhere. The Standard Model Higgs boson is excluded at 95% CL in the mass range 111–559GeV, except for the narrow region 122–131GeV. In this region, an ex- cess of events with signiﬁcance 5 .9σ, corresponding top0=1.7×10−9, is observed.

Taking into account the entire mass range of the search, 110– 600GeV, the global signiﬁcance of the excess is 5 .1σ, whichcorrespondsto p0=1.7×10−7. These results provide conclusive evidence for the discovery of a new particle with mass 126.0±0.4 (stat)±0.4 (sys)GeV. The signal strength parameter µhas the value 1 .4±0.3 at the ﬁtted mass, which is consistent with the SM Higgs boson hypothesis µ=1. The decays to pairs of vector bosons whose net electric charge is zero identify the new particle as a neutral boson. The observation in the diphoton channel disfavours the spin-1 hypothe- sis [140, 141]. Although these results are compatible withthehypothesisthatthenewparticleistheStandard Model Higgs boson, more data are needed to assess its naturein detail.

Sincethen,theanalysisofdatacollectedatcentre-of-massenergiesof7TeV, 8TeV and 13TeV in Runs 1 and 2 of the LHC has led to the observation of many of the production modes and decay channels predicted by the Standard Model (SM). The bosonic decay channels are well established and have entered an era of precision measurements [8–18]. The decay into -lepton pairs was ﬁrst observed in the combination of the ATLAS and CMS analyses [19, 20]. The main Higgs boson production modes, gluon–gluon fusion (ggF) and vector-boson fusion (VBF), were already measured following the analysis of the Run 1 data, and recently the coupling of the Higgs boson to top quarks was directly observed by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations [21, 22] through the observation of the associated production of a Higgs boson and a top-quark pair ( t¯tH). ThedominantdecayoftheSMHiggsbosonisintopairsof b-quarks,withanexpectedbranchingfraction of approximately 58% for a mass of mH=125GeV [23]. However, large backgrounds from multi- jet production make a search in the dominant gluon–gluon fusion production mode very challenging at hadron colliders. The most sensitive production modes for detecting H!b¯bdecays are the associated productionofaHiggsbosonanda WorZboson[24]( VH),wheretheleptonicdecayofthevectorboson enableseﬃcienttriggeringandasigniﬁcantreductionofthemulti-jetbackground. Aswellasprobingthe dominant decay of the Higgs boson, this measurement allows the overall Higgs boson decay width [25, 26] to be constrained and provides the best sensitivity to the ZHandWHproduction modes, which are (for instance) important elements in the interpretation of Higgs

Searches in this channel at the Tevatron by the CDF and D0 Collaborations showed an excess of events with a signiﬁcance of 2.8 standard deviations for a Higgs boson with a mass of 125GeV [28]. Analysing the 2015 and 2016 data and combining with the Run 1 results [29, 30], both the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations reported evidence for Higgs boson production and decay in this channel, with observed (expected)signiﬁcancesof3.6(4.0)and3.8(3.8)standarddeviations,respectively[31,32]. Searchesfor H!b¯bdecays have also been conducted in the VBF [33–35] and t¯tH[36–41] channels, and with high transverse momentum Higgs bosons [42], but with markedly lower sensitivities. This Letter reports an update to the search for the SM Higgs boson decaying into a b¯bpair in the VH production mode with the ATLAS detector in Run 2 of the LHC presented in Ref. [31]. This update uses 79.8 fb 1ofppcollision data collected at a centre-of-mass energy of 13TeV, to be compared with 36.1 fb 1for the previous result. In addition, an updated version of the ATLAS reconstruction code and improvedobjectcalibrationsareused,theimpactoftheluminosityandmodellingsystematicuncertainties are reduced from updated measurements and estimates, and larger samples of simulated events are used to model the background processes. Events are selected in 0-, 1- and 2-lepton channels, based on the number of charged leptons, `(electrons or muons), to explore the ZH!b¯b,WH!`b¯band ZH!``b¯bsignatures, respectively. The dominant background processes after the event selection are V+jets,t¯t,single-topanddibosonprocess. Multivariatediscriminants,builtfromvariablesthatdescribe the kinematics of the selected events, are used to maximise the sensitivity to the Higgs boson signal. Their output distributions are combined using a binned maximum-likelihood ﬁt, referred to as the global likelihoodﬁt,whichallowsthesignalyieldandthebackgroundnormalisationstobeextracted.

The latter two combinations lead to the observation of both the b¯bdecay of the Higgs boson and VH production. An observation of the b¯bdecay of the Higgs boson by the CMS Collaboration [43] was submitted for publication at the same time as this Letter. 2 The ATLAS detector ATLAS [44] is a general-purpose particle detector covering nearly the entire solid angle 1around the collision point. An inner tracking detector, located within a 2 T axial magnetic ﬁeld generated by a thin superconducting solenoid, is used to measure the trajectories and momenta of charged particles. The inner layers consist of high-granularity silicon pixel detectors covering a pseudorapidity range jj<2:5, and include an innermost layer [45, 46] that was added to the detector between Run 1 and Run 2. Silicon microstrip detectors covering jj<2:5are located beyond the pixel detectors. Outside the microstrip detectors and covering jj<2:0, there are straw-tube tracking detectors, which also provide measurements of transition radiation that are used in electron identiﬁcation. A calorimeter system surrounds the inner tracking detector, covering the pseudorapidity range jj<4:9. Within the region jj<3:2,electromagneticcalorimetryisprovidedbybarrel( jj<1:475)andendcap( 1:375<jj<3:2) high-granularity lead/liquid-argon (LAr) sampling calorimeters, with an additional thin LAr presampler coveringjj<1:8tocorrectforenergylossinmaterialupstreamofthecalorimeters. Hadroniccalorimetry is provided by a steel/scintillator-tile calorimeter within jj<1:7, and copper/LAr endcap calorimeters extend the coverage to jj=3:2.

Simulated jets are labelled as b-,c- or light-ﬂavour jets according to which hadrons with pT>5GeV are found within a cone of size R=0:3around their axis. Simulated V+jets events are categorised depending on the labels of the jets that form the Higgs boson candidate: V+llwhen they are both light-ﬂavour jets, V+clwhen there is one c-jet and one light-ﬂavour jet, and V+HF (heavy ﬂavour) in all other cases, mainly two b-jets.

In contrast, the multi-jet background is estimated in all three channels using data-driven methods.

Themulti-jetbackgroundisfoundtobenon-negligibleinthe1-leptonchannelandisestimatedseparately in the electron and muon sub-channels, and in the 2- and 3-jet categories. In each category, a template ﬁt to the transverse mass distribution of the Wboson candidate is performed, which oﬀers the clearest discrimination between the multi-jet and EW processes, to extract the multi-jet yield. The template used for the multi-jet contribution is obtained from data in a control region after subtraction of the residual EW contribution, based on MC predictions, while the template for the EW contribution in the signal region is obtained directly from MC predictions. The control region is enriched in multi-jet events that are kinematically close to the corresponding signal region but not overlapping with it, and is deﬁned by applying the nominal selection but inverting the stricter lepton isolation requirements. To increase the statisticalprecisionofthedata-drivenestimate,thenumberofrequired b-taggedjetsisreducedfromtwo tooneinthemulti-jetenrichedcontrolregion. Thetemplateﬁtappliedinthesignalregiondeterminesthe normalisationofthemulti-jetcontribution,whiletheshapeoftheBDTdiscriminant(orofotherrelevant observables) is obtained using a control region analogously to the mW Ttemplate. Both the normalisation and shape derived for the BDT discriminant are then used in the global likelihood ﬁt. The multi-jet contribution in the 2-jet category is found to be 1:9%(2:8%) of the total background contribution in the electron (muon) sub-channel, while in the 3-jet category it is found to be 0:2%(0:4%). These estimates are subject to sizeable systematic uncertainties, which are described in Section 5. 5 Systematic uncertainties The sources of systematic uncertainty can be broadly divided into four groups: those of experimental nature, those related to the modelling of the simulated
1808.08238v2.pdf|||backgrounds, those related to the multi-jet back- ground estimation, and those associated with the Higgs boson signal simulation. The estimation of the uncertainties closely follows the methodology outlined in Ref. [31] and is brieﬂy summarised below. 5.1 Experimental uncertainties Thedominantexperimentaluncertaintiesoriginatefromthe b-taggingcorrectionfactors,determinedfrom thediﬀerencebetweentheeﬃciencymeasuredindataandsimulation,fromthejetenergyscalecorrections andfromthemodellingofthejetenergyresolution. The b-taggingcorrectionfactorsarederivedseparately forb-jets, c-jetsandlight-ﬂavourjets[107–109]. Allthreecorrectionfactorshaveuncertaintiesestimated from multiple measurements, which are decomposed into uncorrelated components that are then treated 11 independently, resulting in three uncertainties for b-jets and c-jets, and ﬁve for light-ﬂavour jets. The approximate size of the uncertainty in the tagging eﬃciency is 2% for b-jets, 10% for c-jets and 40% for light-ﬂavour jets. Additional uncertainties are considered in the extrapolation of the b-jet eﬃciency calibrationtojetswith pT>300GeVandinthemisidentiﬁcationofhadronicallydecaying -leptonsas b- jets. Theuncertaintiesinthejetenergyscaleandresolutionarebasedontheirrespectivemeasurements[60, 110]. The many sources of uncertainty in the correction of the jet energy scale are decomposed into 23 uncorrelatedcomponentsthataretreatedasindependent. Anadditionalspeciﬁcuncertaintyintheenergy calibration of b- and c-jets is considered. Uncertainties in the reconstruction, identiﬁcation, isolation and trigger eﬃciencies of muons [52] and electrons[50],alongwiththeuncertaintyintheirenergyscaleandresolution,areestimatedusing13TeV data. These are found to have only a small impact on the result. The uncertainties in the energy scale andresolutionofthejetsandleptonsarepropagatedtothecalculationof Emiss T,whichalsohasadditional uncertaintiesfromthescale,resolutionandreconstructioneﬃciencyofthetracksusedtocomputethesoft term[61],alongwiththemodellingoftheunderlyingevent. Anuncertaintyisassignedtothe Emiss Ttrigger correction factors, determined from the diﬀerence between the trigger eﬃciency in data and simulation, to account for the statistical uncertainty in the measured correction factors and for diﬀerences between the correction factors determined from W+ jets, Z+ jets and t¯tevents. The uncertainty in the combined 2015–2017 integrated luminosity is 2.0%. It is derived, following a methodology similar to that detailed inRef.[64],andusingtheLUCID-2detectorforthebaselineluminositymeasurements[65]. Theaverage number of interactions per bunch crossing is rescaled by 1.03 to improve agreement between simulation and data, based on the measurement of the visible cross-section in minimum-bias events [111], and an uncertainty, as large as the correction, is included. 5.2 Simulated sample uncertainties Modelling uncertainties are derived for the simulated samples and broadly cover three
1808.08238v2.pdf|||areas: normal- isations, acceptance diﬀerences that aﬀect the relative normalisations between analysis regions with a common normalisation, and the shapes of the diﬀerential distributions of the most important kinematic variables. Theoverallnormalisationsandassociateduncertaintiesforthebackgroundprocessesaretaken from the currently most accurate calculations as detailed in Table 4, apart from the main backgrounds whose normalisations are left unconstrained (ﬂoated) in the global likelihood ﬁt. The additional system- atic uncertainties in the acceptance diﬀerences and in the shapes are derived either from particle-level comparisons between nominal and alternative simulated samples, or from comparisons with data in con- trol regions. The particle-level comparisons are cross-checked with detector-level simulations whenever these are available, and good agreement is found. The alternative samples were either produced by other generators or by altering the nominal values of generator parameters. When acceptance uncertainties are estimated, the nominal and alternative samples are normalised using the same production cross-section. Shape uncertainties are considered in each of the analysis regions separately, with the samples scaled to have the same normalisation in each region. In this case, the uncertainty is taken from the alternative sample that diﬀers most in shape from the nominal sample. Shape uncertainties are only derived for the mbbandpV Tvariables,asitwasfoundsuﬃcienttoonlyconsiderthechangesinducedinthesevariablesto cover the overall shape variation of the BDT V Hdiscriminant.

V+jetsproduction TheV+jetsbackgrounds are subdivided into three diﬀerent components based upon the jet ﬂavour labels of the two b-tagged jets in the event. The main background contributions (V+bb,V+bc,V+blandV+cc) are jointly considered as the V+HFbackground. Their overall normalisation, separately in the 2- and 3-jet categories, is free to ﬂoat in the global likelihood ﬁt. The remaining ﬂavour components, V+clandV+ll, constitute less than 1% of the background in each analysisregion,soonlyuncertaintiesinthenormalisationofthesebackgroundsareincluded. Acceptance
1808.08238v2.pdf|||uncertainties are estimated for the relative normalisations of the diﬀerent regions that share a common ﬂoating normalisation parameter. In the case of the W+HFbackground, this includes the uncertainties in the ratio of the event yield in the 0-lepton channel to that in the 1-lepton channel and, in the 1-lepton channel, in the ratio of the event yield in the W+HFcontrol region to that in the signal region. For theZ+HFbackground, there is an uncertainty in the ratio of the event yield in the 0-lepton channel to that in the 2-lepton channel. Uncertainties are also estimated in the relative normalisation of the four heavy-ﬂavourcomponentsthatconstitutethe V+HFbackground.

Uncertainties in the shapes of the pV Tandmbbdistributions are estimated in the 0+1- and 2-lepton channels separately from comparisons with alternative samples. In addition, the modelling of the ttbackground is validated in the 2-lepton channel by using the data events from the econtrol region to model this background in the signal region, with good agreement found. Single top-quark production In the Wt- and t-channels, uncertainties are derived for the normalisation, acceptance and shapes of the mbbandpV Tdistributions. For the Wt-channel, the estimated modelling uncertaintiesare basedon theﬂavour ofthe two b-taggedjets, dueto thediﬀerent regionsof phasespace being probed when there are two b-jets ( bb) present compared with events where
1808.08238v2.pdf|||there are fewer b-jets present (other). Only a normalisation uncertainty is derived for the s-channel, since its contribution is negligible overall. Diboson production The diboson backgrounds are composed of three distinct processes: W Z,WWand Z Zproduction. Given the small contribution from WWproduction ( <0:1%of the total background) only a normalisation uncertainty is assigned. The more important contributions from the W ZandZ Z backgrounds have uncertainties derived for the overall normalisation, the relative acceptance between 13 Table 5: Summary of the systematic uncertainties in the background modelling for Z+ jets, W+ jets, tt, single top-quark and multi-jet production.

They are derivedfollowingtheprocedureoutlinedinRef.[31],butwithupdatedalternativesamplesgeneratedwith a larger number of events, and using a parameter tune optimized more recently for the evaluation of the parton shower uncertainty. This substantially reduces the parton shower and underlying event (PS/UE) uncertainties. The systematic uncertainties in the calculations of the VHproduction cross-sections and theH!b¯bbranching fraction 4are assigned following the recommendations of the LHC Higgs Cross Section Working Group [26, 92, 93, 112, 113]. 4Suchsystematicuncertaintiesfullydegeneratewiththesignalyielddonotaﬀectthecalculationofthesigniﬁcancerelativeto the background-only prediction. 15 Table7:Summaryofthesystematicuncertaintiesinthesignalmodelling.

Several uncertainties are considered, uncorrelated between the electron and muon sub-channels. The respective variations are added in quadrature for the normalisations, or considered as separate shape uncertainties. Variations are obtained by changing the deﬁnition of the multi-jetcontrolregion(morestringentisolationrequirements,adiﬀerentsingle-electrontriggertoprobe apotentialtriggerbiasintheisolationrequirements),andvaryingthenormalisationofthecontamination from the top ( t¯tandWt) and V+jetsprocesses in the multi-jet control region. In addition, the following systematic uncertainties have an impact only on the multi-jet normalisation: use of another discriminant variable instead of mW Tfor the template ﬁt (the azimuthal separation between the directions of the lepton transversemomentumandthevectorialsumofthemomentaofthetwoorthreejets)and,fortheelectron sub-channel only, the inclusion of the Emiss T<30GeV region, which signiﬁcantly enhances the multi-jet contribution in the template ﬁt. 6 Statistical analysis The statistical procedure is based on a likelihood function L¹;º, constructed as the product of Poisson probability terms over the bins of the input distributions. The parameter of interest, , is the signal strengththatmultipliestheSMHiggsbosonproductioncross-sectiontimesthebranchingfractioninto
1808.08238v2.pdf|||b¯b and is extracted by maximising the likelihood. Systematic uncertainties enter the likelihood as nuisance parameters (NP), . Most of the uncertainties discussed in Section 5 are constrained with Gaussian or log-normal probability density functions. The normalisations of the largest backgrounds, t¯t,W+HF andZ+HF, can be reliably determined by the ﬁt, so they are left unconstrained in the likelihood. The uncertainties due to the limited number of events in the simulated samples used for the background predictions are included using the Beeston–Barlow technique [114]. As detailed in Ref. [30], systematic 16 Table8:Factorsappliedtothenominalnormalisationsofthe tt,W+HFandZ+HFbackgrounds,asobtainedfrom the global likelihood ﬁt to the 13 TeV data for the nominal multivariate analysis, used to extract the Higgs boson signal.

The method diﬀers from the global likelihood ﬁt only by the use of the BDT V Zoutput distributions as inputs, instead of BDT V H. The parameter of interest, V Z, is the signal strength of the combined W ZandZ Zdiboson processes, and the SM Higgs boson is included asabackgroundprocessnormalisedtothepredictedSMcross-sectionwithanuncertaintyof50%,which conservatively encompasses the previous measurement and uncertainty [31]. 18 6.4 Combinations 6.4.1 Run 1 Theresultsofthestatisticalanalysisofthe13TeVdataarecombinedwiththosefromthedatarecordedat 7 TeV and 8 TeV [30] to improve the precision of the measurement. Detailed studies of the impact of the

Only a b-jet-speciﬁc jet energy scale, and theory uncertaintiesintheHiggsbosonsignal(overallcross-section,branchingfractionand pV T-dependentNLO EW corrections) are correlated across the diﬀerent centre-of-mass energies. 6.4.2 H!b¯b Asecondcombinationisperformedwiththeresultsofthesearchesforthe H!b¯bdecayinthe t¯tH[36, 38] and VBF [33, 35] production modes carried out with the Run 1 and Run 2 data. As the analysis targeting the VBF production mode has a sizeable contribution from gluon–gluon fusion events, it is referred to as the VBF+ggF analysis in the following. Constraining the cross-sections of the production modes to be as predicted by the SM, the combination measures the ratio of the branching fraction of the Higgs boson into b-quarks to the SM prediction. The only NP correlated across the six analyses is the H!b¯bbranching fraction that aﬀects the SM prediction. A few other NPs are correlated across some oftheanalyses,followingthestudiesconductedforthecombinationsofRun1results[19],ofanalysesof thet¯tHproduction mode [21], and of Run 2 results. 6.4.3 V H A third combination is also performed combining the Run 2 VH,H!b¯bresult with other results in the VHproductionmode,butforthecaseoftheHiggsbosondecayingintotwophotonsorvia Z Zintofour leptons.

The signal yield is extracted in each category using a ﬁt to the diphoton invariant mass distribution in the range 105–160GeV.

The Higgs boson mass 𝑚𝐻is a fundamental parameter of the SM and the only unknown parameter of the scalar sector of the Standard Model prior tothe Higgs boson discovery. Its measurement is of paramount importanceforseveralreasons. Firstly,itsvaluedeterminestheHiggsbosonproductionratesanddecay branching ratios [3]. It is also the value assumed by the experimental collaborations when estimating theacceptances,efficienciesandsignalmodelsusedintheiranalysesandtoreporttheirmeasuredrates. KnowledgeoftheHiggsbosonmassisthereforemandatoryforacoherenttestofitscouplingstructure.
2308.07216v2.pdf|||Secondly, the Higgs boson mass is one of the inputs in global fits to the measurements of electroweak observables[4]. Knowingitsvaluethereforeplaysakeyroleinverifyingtheinternalconsistencyofthe SM, especially through the interplay between the masses of the top quark and the 𝑊and Higgs bosons. Finally, the stability of the electroweak vacuum, and thus the fate of our universe, depends on the value of theHiggsbosonmass[5]. Bymeasuring 𝑚𝐻,onecaninferwhethertheuniverseisinaglobal,andthus stable, minimum-energy state of the Higgs field potential, or in a local metastable one, from which it could decay to the ground state in the future [6]. Measurements of the Higgs boson mass were performed separately by the ATLAS [7] and CMS [8] collaborations using Higgs boson decays to the high-resolution four-lepton ( 4ℓ,ℓ=𝑒,𝜇) and diphoton (𝛾𝛾) final states reconstructed during the first data-taking phase of the LHC (Run 1). The data consisted of 25fb−1ofproton–proton( 𝑝𝑝)collisionsrecordedatcentre-of-massenergies√𝑠=7and8TeVin2011 and2012. ThecombinationoftheATLASandCMSresultsledtoameasurementoftheHiggsbosonmass with an uncertainty of 0.19%, 𝑚𝐻=125.09±0.24GeV [9]. 2 Updated measurements of the Higgs boson mass were performed by both experiments using 𝑝𝑝collisions collected at√𝑠=13TeVbetween 2015 and 2018 during the second data-taking phase of the LHC (Run 2). Using both𝐻→𝑍𝑍∗→4ℓand𝐻→𝛾𝛾decays selected in a partial Run 2 dataset (36 fb−1of𝑝𝑝 collisions recorded before 2017), the ATLAS Collaboration measured 𝑚𝐻=124.86±0.27GeV[10]. CombinedwiththeATLASRun1resultsfromRef.[7],thisstudyledtoaHiggsbosonmassmeasurement of𝑚𝐻=124.97±0.24GeV. Using a dataset of equivalent size and both the four-lepton and diphoton final states, the CMS Collaboration found 𝑚𝐻=125.46±0.16GeV[11], whose combination with the Run 1 results from Ref. [8] led to the most precise determination of 𝑚𝐻to date, with a 0.11% uncertainty: 𝑚𝐻=125.38±0.14GeV. Recently, the ATLAS Collaboration released an updated measurement of 𝑚𝐻 using𝐻→𝑍𝑍∗→4ℓdecays in the full Run 2 dataset [12], consisting of 140 fb−1of𝑝𝑝collisions.

Finally,a combination with the ATLAS Run 1 measurement [9] is performed. The rest of the Letter is organised as follows. The ATLAS detector is described briefly in Section 2. The data and simulated event samples used in the analysis are summarised in Section 3. The photon reconstructionandtheeventselectionandclassificationarediscussedinSection4. Thestatisticaltoolsused in the measurement and the methods used to assess the systematic uncertainties are presented in Sections 5 and 6, leading to the results described in Section 7. The conclusions of this study are summarised in Section 8. 2 The ATLAS detector The ATLAS experiment [15] at the LHC is a multipurpose particle detector with a forward–backward symmetric cylindrical geometry and a near 4𝜋coverage in solid angle.1It consists of an inner tracking detectorsurroundedbyathinsuperconductingsolenoidprovidinga 2Taxialmagneticfield,electromagnetic and hadron calorimeters, and a muon spectrometer. The inner tracking detector covers the pseudorapidity 1ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the centre of the detector and the 𝑧-axis along the beam pipe. The 𝑥-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the 𝑦-axis points upwards. Cylindrical coordinates (𝑟,𝜙)are used in the transverse plane, 𝜙being the azimuthal angle around the 𝑧-axis. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle 𝜃as𝜂=−ln tan(𝜃/2). Angular distance is measured in units of Δ𝑅≡√︁ (Δ𝜂)2+(Δ𝜙)2. The transverse energy is defined as 𝐸T=𝐸sin(𝜃). 3 range|𝜂|<2.5. Itconsistsofsiliconpixel,siliconmicrostrip,andtransitionradiationtrackingdetectors. Lead/liquid-argon (LAr) sampling calorimeters provide electromagnetic (EM) energy measurements withhigh granularity. Asteel/scintillator-tile hadroncalorimetercovers thecentralpseudorapidityrange (|𝜂|<1.7).
2308.07216v2.pdf|||The endcap and forward regions are instrumented with LAr calorimeters for both the EM and hadronic energy measurements up to |𝜂|=4.9. The muon spectrometer surrounds the calorimeters and is based on three large superconducting air-core toroidal magnets with eight coils each. The field integral of the toroids ranges between 2.0and6.0Tmacross most of the detector. The muon spectrometer includes a system of precision chambers for tracking and fast detectors for triggering. A two-level trigger system is used to select events. The first-level trigger is implemented in hardware and uses a subset of the detector information to accept events at a rate below 100kHz. This is followed by a software-based trigger that reduces the accepted event rate to 1kHzon average depending on the data-taking conditions. An extensive softwaresuite [16]is used indata simulation, inthe reconstructionand analysis ofreal and simulated data, in detector operations, and in the trigger and data acquisition systems of the experiment. 3 Data and simulation samples 3.1 Data Themeasurementusesthefull 𝑝𝑝collisiondatasetcollectedat√𝑠=13TeVbytheATLASdetectorduring Run 2 of the LHC. Events were recorded using unprescaled diphoton and single-photon triggers [17]. The photontransversemomentumthresholdswere35 GeVand25GeVforthediphotontriggersthroughoutthe whole of Run 2, and 120 (140) GeVfor single-photon triggers in 2015–2016 (2017–2018). Shower-shape requirements looser than those used in the offline analysis were applied to the photon candidates at the triggerlevel. Theintegratedluminosityofthedatasetaftertriggeranddata-qualityrequirements[18]is 140.1±1.2fb−1[19,20]. Theefficiencyofthetriggersystemforsignaleventspassingthefullselectionis close to 100% [17]. 3.2 Simulation samples Monte Carlo (MC) simulated event samples of Higgs bosons produced by 𝑝𝑝collisions and decaying into diphotons,aswellassamplesofthemainbackgroundprocessesforthesamefinalstate,wereproduced with the set-up described in Ref. [21]. Simulated hard-scattering events were overlaid with simulated inelastic proton–proton events generated with Pythia8.1 [22], to model the effect of multiple ‘pile-up’ interactions in the same and neighbouring bunch crossings. Signal samples were produced for the main Higgs boson production modes: gluon–gluon fusion (ggF), vector-bosonfusion(VBF),andassociatedproductionwithavectorboson( 𝑉𝐻,𝑉=𝑊,𝑍),atop-quark pair (𝑡¯𝑡𝐻), a bottom-quark pair ( 𝑏¯𝑏𝐻) or a single top quark
2308.07216v2.pdf|||( 𝑡𝐻). Signal event samples were produced with either the Powheg Box [23] or (for𝑡𝐻only) MadGraph5_aMC@NLO [24] event generator, using matrixelementcalculationsatthehighestavailableorderofaccuracyinthestrongcouplingconstant 𝛼s: next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) for ggF, next-to-leading order (NLO) for VBF, 𝑊𝐻,𝑞¯𝑞→𝑍𝐻, 𝑡¯𝑡𝐻,𝑏¯𝑏𝐻and𝑡𝐻, and leading order (LO) for 𝑔𝑔→𝑍𝐻. The event generators were interfaced to Pythia8.2 [25] for the modelling of the parton shower and the underlying event. In the analysis the 4 samples are normalised to the integrated luminosity of the data, using state-of-the-art Standard Model calculations for the Higgs boson production cross-sections and branching ratios at the hypothesised Higgs bosonmass[3]. Thegeneratedsignalsampleswerepassedthroughadetailedsimulationoftheresponseof the ATLAS detector [26] based on Geant4[27]. The nominal signal samples were generated assuming a Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV. The Higgs boson widthΓin all signal samples was set to the SM prediction for 𝑚𝐻=125GeV,Γ=4.07MeV, which is much narrower than the experimental resolution. Systematic uncertainties related to the modelling of the partonshowerarestudiedwithalternativesamplesproducedwiththesamematrix-elementgeneratoras used for the nominal ones but with the Herwig7.1.3 parton shower algorithm [28]. The parameterisations oftheexpectedsignalyieldsanddiphotoninvariantmassdistributionsasafunctionoftheHiggsboson mass are obtained by interpolation between results from signal samples with 𝑚𝐻set to 110, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 130 or 140 GeV, as described in Section 5. The same set-up as that for the nominal samples was used. Background events from non-resonant 𝑝𝑝→𝛾𝛾+𝑛parton(𝑛≥0)production were also simulated, using the Sherpa2.2.4 event generator [29] with NLO-accurate matrix elements for up to one parton, and leading-order(LO)accuratematrixelementsforuptothreepartons. Duetoitslargesize,the 𝑝𝑝→𝛾𝛾 sample was processed by a fast simulation of the ATLAS detector [30], based on a parameterisation of the responseofthecalorimeter. Sincethediphotonbackgroundisestimatedfromthesidebandsinthediphoton invariant mass distribution in data, the background simulation is only used to select the background model and the systematic uncertainty associated with this choice, and for this the fast simulation was found to be sufficiently accurate. The effect of interference between resonant signal production and non-resonant background diphoton production is
2308.07216v2.pdf|||studied using samples of simulated diphoton events including contributions from both processes (produced by either the 𝑔𝑔or𝑞𝑔partonic channels) and their interference. The accuracy of the calculations is NLO for the 𝑔𝑔-interference and LO for the 𝑞𝑔-interference samples. The events were generated using Sherpa2.2.11 and passed through the Geant4detector simulation. 4 Event selection and classification The event reconstruction and selection closely resemble those used in the latest ATLAS measurement of Higgs boson production cross-sections using the diphoton channel and the full Run 2 dataset [21]. The main differences are the use of an updated photon energy calibration [14] with reduced systematic uncertainties, and the classification of events into categories that are optimised to minimise the uncertainty in the measured Higgs boson mass rather than in the Higgs boson production cross-sections. Comparedwiththepreviousmassmeasurement[10],whichusedphotoncandidatesreconstructedfrom afixed-sizeclusterofenergydepositsintheelectromagneticcalorimeteridentifiedbyasliding-window algorithm,thismeasurementreliesonphotoncandidatesthatarereconstructedfromdynamic,variable-size clusters,calledsuperclusters. Themainadvantagesofthisalgorithmareimprovementsinthereconstruction efficiency and energy measurement of converted photons ( 𝛾→𝑒+𝑒−), and a lower rate of misclassifying unconverted photons as converted photon candidates [13]. Thephotonenergyisdeterminedfromthesignalsduetoenergydepositedintheelectromagneticcalorimeter, after applying the calibration scheme detailed in Ref. [14]. The photon direction is calculated from the positions of the supercluster and the 𝑝𝑝collision vertex that is chosen from among the reconstructed 5 primary vertex candidatesbya neural-network (NN) algorithm [31]. The NN inputs are the directionsof thetwo𝑝T-leadingphoton candidatesintheevent,determinedonly fromtheconversion verticesandthe longitudinal sampling of the calorimeter, and vertex candidate information such as the transverse momenta and directions of the associated tracks. Theselectionretainseventswithatleasttwophotoncandidateswithpseudorapidityintherange |𝜂|<1.37 or1.52<|𝜂|<2.37,meeting tightidentificationand looseisolationcriteria[13],matchedtotheonline photoncandidatesthatpassedthetriggerselection.

Whenmorethantwophotoncandidatespassthoserequirements, only the𝑝T-leading and 𝑝T-subleading candidates are considered for further analysis. About 1.2 million events in the data pass the selection. The expected efficiency for the signal for 𝑚𝐻=125GeV is close to 36%, leading to an expected signal yield of about 6200 events.

Themodelassumes that the observed distribution arises from the sum of a signal and a background component, whose shape and normalisation are inferred from the data themselves, with some input from the simulation. The𝑚𝛾𝛾distribution of the simulated signal in each category is found to be properly described, for any value of the Higgs boson mass in the range [110,140] GeV, by a double-sided Crystal Ball [34] probability density function, i.e. a function with a Gaussian core and power-law tails.

The nominal values of the parameters 𝑎𝜇,𝑏𝜇,𝑎𝜎,𝑏𝜎,𝛼±and𝑛±in each category are determined by a simultaneous fit to the simulated diphoton invariant mass spectra in that category for different 𝑚𝐻hypotheses. As a cross-check, the fit is repeated after removing the 𝑚𝐻=125GeVdistribution from the input and new values of the 𝑎𝜇,𝑏𝜇,𝑎𝜎,𝑏𝜎,𝛼±and𝑛±parameters are obtained.

The expected statistical uncertainty of 120 MeVin𝑚𝐻is a factor of 2.1 less than in the previous measurement [10], due to the present dataset being almost four times larger and improvements in the 9 photon reconstruction algorithm and event classification. 6 Systematic uncertainties The main sources of systematic uncertainty in 𝑚𝐻are the uncertainties in the photon energy scale, the uncertaintyfromthebackgroundmodellingandtheeffectofinterferencebetweenthesignalandthe 𝛾𝛾 continuum background. They are described below, together with their expected pre-fit impact on 𝑚𝐻. The photon energy scale uncertainty is modelled by using 67 independent components.

Theshiftsinducedinthepeakparameters 𝜇CBoftheCrystalBallsignalmodelsarethenincludedas nuisance parameters in the likelihood function, fully correlated among the categories. The 67 independent sources of uncertainty in the photon energy scale can be classified roughly into four main groups. The first group(𝑍→𝑒+𝑒−calibration )isrelatedtothedeterminationofthe 𝜂-dependentenergyscalefactorsfor electronsandpositronsfrom 𝑍bosondecays,effectivelyconstrainingtheirenergyscaleforatransverse energy𝐸T≈45GeV. Thesecondgroup( 𝐸T-dependentelectronenergyscale )includesuncertaintiesin the𝐸T-dependence of the energy scale from sources such as the calorimeter readout non-linearity, the calorimeter layer intercalibration, and the amount of material upstream of the calorimeter. The third group (𝑒±→𝛾extrapolation )includestheuncertaintiesintheextrapolationoftheenergyscalefromelectronsto photons,arising,forinstance,frompotentialmismodellingofdifferencesinlateralshowerdevelopment betweenelectronsandphotonsinthecalorimeter. Finally,thefourthgroup( conversionmodelling )contains the uncertainties related to the accuracy of the photon conversion modelling in the simulation. Since the simulation-based photon energy calibration [14] is trained and applied separately for unconverted andconvertedphotoncandidates,anymismodellingoftheconversionreconstructionperformanceinthe simulation may affect the calibrated photon energy scale. TheresultspresentedinthisLetterprofitfromanewauxiliarymeasurement( linearityfit )ofthedata-to-MC electronenergy scalecorrectionsasafunction oftheelectron 𝐸T. Inthephoton energyscalecalibration used in the previous Higgs boson mass measurement [10], only 𝜂-dependent energy scale factors were derived from 2015–2016 data. These were obtained by comparing the position of the peak of the invariant massdistributionof 𝑒+𝑒−pairsfrom𝑍bosondecayswiththatpredictedbythesimulation. Thepossible 𝐸T-dependence of the data-to-MC energy scale correction was accounted for as a systematic uncertainty, arising from the various

[14] exploits the larger sample of 𝑍→𝑒+𝑒−decays collectedin2015–2018toderiveresidualdata-to-MCenergyscalefactorsinbinsofelectrontransverse energy within broad 𝜂regions. The measurement of these additional scale factors is used to constrain the 𝐸T-dependent electron energy scale systematic uncertainties. The additional constraints and correlation of the systematic uncertainties from the linearity fit are propagated to the Higgs boson mass measurement by implementinginthelikelihoodfunctionamultivariateGaussianconstrainttermwhosecovarianceisthat returned by the linearity fit. The impact of the photon energy scale systematic uncertainties, including the effect of the linearity fit, was found to be independent of 𝑚𝐻for Higgs boson mass values in the range 124–126GeV,andisexpectedtobeapproximately ±83MeV(withcontributionsof60,43,30and23 MeV, respectively,fromthefourindividualgroupsof 𝑍→𝑒+𝑒−calibration,𝐸T-dependentelectronenergyscale, 𝑒±→𝛾extrapolation andconversion modellinguncertainties). Comparedto theresultsin Ref.[10], the simulation’s more accurate description [13] of material upstream of the EM calorimeter and the lower 10 sensitivity of the new clustering algorithm to the effects of interactions with detector material reduced the associated systematicuncertaintyby a factorclose to three. In addition, thelarger dataset alloweda more precise studyof the 𝑒±→𝛾extrapolationprocedure [14], andits impacton theexpected 𝑚𝐻uncertainty is reduced by a factor larger than three. Furthermore, the contribution of the 𝐸T-dependent electron energy scaleuncertaintiestothetotalexpected 𝑚𝐻uncertaintyhasbeenreducedbyafactoroftwothankstomore precise dedicated measurements. Finally, the linearity fit constrains the expected uncertainty in the Higgs boson mass from the group of 𝐸T-dependent energy scale uncertainties by a further factor of four.

In the Standard Model, this interference is expected to change the signal cross-sectionby1%–2%[36]andtoshiftthepositionofthepeakinthediphotoninvariantmassdistribution by a few tens of MeV[37]. The size of this effect is treated as a systematic uncertainty, which is quantified by fitting the nominal signal-plus-background model to the sum of the 𝑚𝛾𝛾distributions predicted by the nominal signal and background models and the 𝑚𝛾𝛾distribution arising from such interference in

Besides its mass, its width — related to its lifetime — is an important parameter. One way to determine this quantity is by measuring its off-shell produc- tion, where the Higgs boson mass is far away from its nominal value, and relating it to its on-shell production, where the mass is close to the nominal value. Here, we re- port evidence for such off-shell contributions to the production cross section of two Z bosons with data from the CMS experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. We constrain the total rate of the off-shell Higgs boson contribution beyond the Z boson pair production threshold, relative to its standard model expectation, to the interval [0.0061, 2.0 ]at 95% conﬁdence level. The scenario with no off-shell contribution is ex- cluded at a p-value of 0.0003 (3.6 standard deviations). We measure the width of the Higgs boson as GH=3.2+2.4  1.7MeV, in agreement with the standard model expectation of 4.1 MeV. In addition, we set constraints on anomalous Higgs boson couplings to W and Z boson pairs.

These are fermions, which are the building blocks of ordinary matter, and gauge bosons, which are the carriers of the electroweak (EW) and strong forces. In addition, the SM
2202.06923v2.pdf|||postulates the existence of a quantum ﬁeld responsible for the generation of the masses of fundamental particles through a phenomenon known as the Brout–Englert–Higgs mechanism. This ﬁeld, known as the Higgs ﬁeld [1–3], interacts with SM particles, giving them mass, as well as with itself. The ﬁeld carrier is a massive, scalar (spin-0) particle known as the Higgs (H) boson. Nearly half a century after its postulation, it was ﬁnally observed in 2012 with a mass mHof around 125 GeV by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations [4– 6] at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Given the unique role the H boson plays in the SM, studies of its properties are a major goal of particle physics. Apart from mass, another important property of a particle is its lifetime t. Only a few funda- mental particles are stable; others—including the H boson—exist only for a ﬂeeting moment before disintegrating into other, lighter, species. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle [7] pro- vides a direct connection between the lifetime of a particle and the uncertainty in its mass, a property known as the particle’s width, G. Any unstable particle (often referred to as a res- onance ) has a ﬁnite lifetime, with shorter tcorresponding to broader G. The two quantities are related through the Planck constant, h, asG=h/(2pt). Even with perfect experimental resolution, the observed mass of an unstable particle will not be constant across a series of mea- surements (e.g., of the invariant mass of its decay products i, which is calculated from the sums of their energies, Ei, and momenta, ~pi, asp (åiEi)2 jåi~pij2). The possible mass values are distributed according to a characteristic relativistic Breit–Wigner distribution [8] with a nomi- nal mass value corresponding to the maximum of the Breit–Wigner, and with width parameter G. Particles are understood to be on
2202.06923v2.pdf|||the mass shell (on-shell) if their mass is close to the nominal mass value, and off-shell if their mass takes a value far away from it. By the aforementioned property of the Breit–Wigner line shape, particles are generally more likely to be produced on- shell than off-shell when energy and momentum conservation allows it. Scattering amplitudes (A) for off-shell particle production, followed by a speciﬁc decay ﬁnal state, may be modiﬁed further by interference with other processes, which is large and destructive in the case of the H boson. In this speciﬁc case, writing A =H+C, with H standing for the H boson contribu- tion and C for other interfering contributions, we will use the term “off-shell production” as a shorthand for the jHj2term injAj2. For broad resonances, the width can be obtained by directly measuring the Breit–Wigner line shape, e.g., as was done in the case of the Z boson, measured to have a mass of mZ=91.188 0.002 GeV and a width of GZ=2.4950.002 GeV at the CERN Large Electron Positron col- lider [9]. The H boson is expected to live three orders of magnitude longer, with a theoretically predicted width of GH=4.1 MeV (0.0041 GeV) [10], and a deviation from the SM prediction would indicate the existence of new physics. This width is too small to be measured directly from the line shape because of the limited mass resolution of order 1 GeV achievable with the present LHC detectors. Another direct way of measuring the H boson width would be to mea- sure its lifetime by means of its decay length and use the relationship GH=h/(2ptH), but its lifetime is still too short ( tH=1.610 22s) to be detectable directly. The present experimental limit on this quantity is tH<1.910 13s at 95% conﬁdence level (CL) [11], nine orders of magnitude
2202.06923v2.pdf|||above the SM lifetime. The value of GHcan be extracted with much better precision through a combined measurement of on-shell and off-shell H boson production. In the decay of an H boson with mH125 GeV 2 to a pair of massive gauge bosons V (V =W or Z, with masses around 80.4 or 91.2 GeV, respectively), we have mV<mH<2mV. Therefore, when the H boson is produced on-shell (with the VV invariant mass mVVmH), one of the V bosons must be off-shell to satisfy four- momentum conservation. Once the H boson is produced off-shell with large enough invariant mass mVV>2mV(off-shell H boson production region), the V bosons themselves are produced on-shell. Since the Breit–Wigner mass distribution of either the H or V boson maximizes at their respective nominal masses, the rate of off-shell H boson production above the V boson pair production threshold is enhanced with respect to what one would expect from the Breit– Wigner line shape of the H boson alone. The measurement of the higher part of the mVVspectrum can then be used to establish off-shell H boson production. The ratio of off-shell to on-shell production rates allows for a measure- ment of GH[12, 13] via the cross section proportionality relations son-shellµg2 pg2 d GHµmp)soff-shellµg2 pg2 dµmpGH, where gpand gdare the couplings associated with the H boson production and decay modes, respectively, and mpis the on-shell H boson signal strength in the production mode being con- sidered. Each signal strength is deﬁned as the ratio of the H boson squared amplitude in the measured cross section to that predicted in the SM. The off-shell H boson signal strength, moff-shell p , can be expressed as mpGHin each production mode, and the scenario with no off-shell production becomes equivalent to the limiting case GH=0. For the rest of this
2202.06923v2.pdf|||article, we con- centrate on the ZZ decay channel, i.e., gdcorresponding to the H !ZZ decay. The CMS and ATLAS Collaborations have previously used this method to set upper limits on GHas low as 9.2 MeV at 95% CL [14, 15]. It is important to distinguish between two types of H boson production modes: the gluon fusion gg!H!ZZ process, where the H boson is produced via its couplings to fermions, and the EW processes, which involve HVV (i.e., HWW or HZZ) couplings. The top row of Fig. 1 shows the Feynman diagrams for the most dominant contributions to the gg (top left) process, and the EW processes of vector boson fusion (VBF, top center) and VH (top right). A more complete set of diagrams for the EW process are shown in Extended Data Figs. 1 and 2. Because different H boson couplings are involved in the gg and EW processes, we extract two off-shell signal strength parameters moff-shell Ffor the gg mode and moff-shell Vfor the EW mode. We also consider an overall off-shell signal strength parameter moff-shellwith different assumptions on the ratio Roff-shell V,F=moff-shell V/moff-shell F. A major challenge arises from the fact that there are other sources of ZZ pairs in the SM (con- tinuum ZZ production), see for example the bottom row of Fig. 1. These contributions, par- ticularly those from q q!ZZ, are typically much larger than the contribution from off-shell H!ZZ. In addition, some of the amplitudes from continuum ZZ processes interfere with the H boson amplitudes because they share the same initial and ﬁnal states. For example, the amplitudes in the ﬁrst column of Fig. 1, or those in the second column, interfere with each other; the amplitude shown in the lower right panel (shown more generically in Extended Data Fig. 3) does not
2202.06923v2.pdf|||interfere with any of the other diagrams as we omit the negligible contribution of qq!H!ZZ that would interfere with it. The interference between the H boson and continuum ZZ amplitudes is destructive [16–21]. This destructive interference plays a key role in the SM as it is one of the contributions that uni- tarizes the scattering of massive gauge bosons, keeping the computation of the cross section for ZZ production in proton-proton (pp) collisions ﬁnite [16–19]. Figure 2 displays the interplay 3 g gHZ Zgg!H!ZZ: q1 q2q0 1 q0 2W WZ ZHq1q2!q0 1q0 2H!q0 1q0 2ZZ: q qZZ Hff Z Zqq!ZH!ZZZ : g gZ Zgg!ZZ: q1 q2q0 1 q0 2WZ Zq1q2!q0 1q0 2ZZ: q qZ Zqq!ZZ: Figure 1: Feynman diagrams for important contributions to ZZ production.

In the parametrization of the total cross section, contributions from this type of interference between the H boson and continuum ZZ amplitudes scale withp moff-shell Fandp moff-shell Vfor the gg and EW modes, respectively. In this article, we study off-shell H boson decays to ZZ !2`2n, and on-shell as well as off-shell H boson decays to ZZ !4`(`=mor e),
2202.06923v2.pdf|||using a sample of pp collisions at 13 TeV collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC. The selection and analysis of the off-shell ZZ !2`2n data sample is described in detail in this article, and it is based on data collected between 2016 and 2018, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb 1. For the ZZ!4`mode, we use previously published CMS off-shell (2016 and 2017 data sets, 78 fb 1[15]) and on-shell (2015 [15, 22] and 2016–2018 [23] data sets, 2.3 fb 1and 138 fb 1, respectively) results. Information on the off-shell signal strengths, GH, and constraints on possible beyond-the-SM (BSM) anomalous couplings are extracted from combined ﬁts over several kinematic distri- butions of the selected 2 `2nand 4 `events. While off-shell events are the ones solely used to establish the presence of off-shell H boson production, the measurement of GHrelies on the combination of on-shell and off-shell data. Because of the presence of neutrinos, the H boson mass cannot be precisely reconstructed in the H!2`2nﬁnal state as the longitudinal component of the total momentum carrried by the neutrinos cannot be measured. Thus, on-shell information can only be extracted from the 4 ` mode. This combination of 4 `and 2 `2ndata enables the measurement of GHwith a precision of50%.

The distributions are shown after requiring that all charged leptons satisfy pT>7 GeV andjhj<2.4, and that the invariant mass of any charged lepton pair with same ﬂavor and opposite charge is greater than 4 GeV. Here, pTdenotes the magnitude of the momentum of these leptons transverse to the pp collision axis, and hdenotes their pseudorapidity, deﬁned as  ln[tan(q/2)]using the angle qbetween their momentum vector and the collision axis. Calculations for the gg !4`and EW ZZ (!2`2n) +qq pro- cesses exhibit similar qualitative properties. The details of the Monte Carlo programs used for these calculations are given in the Methods section. 5 compared to the direct constraint from Ref. [11].

The mZZline shape is sensitive to the potential presence of anomalous HVV couplings [10, 11, 15, 24–26]. Thus, BSM physics could affect the ratio of off-shell to on-shell H boson production rates, and therefore the
2202.06923v2.pdf|||measurement of GH. We test the effect of these couplings on the GH measurement and constrain the contribution from these couplings themselves.

The BSM couplings a2,a3, and 1/ L2 1(denoted generically as ai) are assumed to be real and can take negative values, with the kfactors in Ref. [15] absorbed into the deﬁnition of 1/ L2 1. The ﬁrst two are coefﬁcients for generic CP-conserving and CP-violating higher dimensional operators, respectively, while 1/ L2 1is the coefﬁcient for the ﬁrst-order term in the expansion of a SM-like tensor structure with an anomalous dipole form factor in the invariant masses of the two V bosons. In what follows, we will use the shorthand “ aihypothesis” to refer to the scenario where all BSM HVV couplings other than aiitself are zero. Throughout this work, we assume that the gluon fusion loop amplitudes do not receive new physics contributions apart from a rescaling of the SM amplitude. Possible modiﬁcations of the mZZline shape [26, 27] are neglected based on existing LHC constraints [28–30]. 2`2nanalysis considerations The 2 `2nanalysis is based on the reconstruction of Z !``decays with a second Z boson decay- ing to neutrinos that escape detection. The momentum of the undetected Z boson transverse to the pp collision axis can be measured through an imbalance across all remaining particles, i.e., missing transverse momentum ( pmiss Tor~pmiss Tin vector form). Thus, the analysis requires large pmiss Tas the Z!nnsignature. The event selection is sensitive to the
2202.06923v2.pdf|||tail of the instrumental pmiss Tresolution in pp!Z+jets events that constitute an important reducible background. This contribution is estimated through a study of a data control region (CR) of g+jets events, where pmiss Tis purely instrumental as it is in Z+jets events. Processes such as pp !tt or WW result in nonresonant dilepton ﬁnal states of same (e+e  andm+m ) and opposite ﬂavor (em) with the same probability and the same kinematic prop- erties. Thus, their background contribution to the 2 `2nsignal, which includes two leptons of the same ﬂavor, is estimated from an opposite-ﬂavor e mCR. Other backgrounds from q q!ZZ, q q0!WZ with W!`nand an undetected lepton, and the small contribution from tZ production are estimated from simulation. A third CR of trilepton events, consisting mostly of q q0!WZ events, is used to constrain the q q0!WZ background and, most importantly, the large q q!ZZ background. The ability to constrain qq!ZZ from q q0!WZ is based on the similarity in the physics of these processes. Further details on event selection, kinematic observables, and the methods to estimate the dif- ferent contributions are discussed in the Methods section. 6 2`2nkinematic observables The analysis of off-shell H boson events is based on mZZ. This quantity is computed from the reconstructed momenta in the 4 `ﬁnal state as the invariant mass of the 4 `system, m4`. How- ever, because of the undetected neutrinos, we can only use the transverse mass mZZ T, deﬁned below, as a proxy for mZZin the 2 `2nﬁnal state. First, we identify ~pmiss Tas the transverse mo- mentum vector of the Z boson decaying into neutrinos. Since there is no information on the longitudinal momenta of the neutrinos, mZZ Tis then computed as the invariant mass of the ZZ pair with all longitudinal momenta set to zero. This

The kinematic quantity pmiss Titself is used as another observable to discriminate processes with genuine, large pmiss Tagainst the Z+jets background. Finally, in events with at least two jets, we use matrix element ( MELA [26]) kinematic discriminants that distinguish the VBF process from the gg process or SM backgrounds. These discriminants are the DVBF 2jet-type kinematic discriminants used in Refs. [15, 23], and are based on the four-momenta of the H boson and the two jets leading in pT. Data interpretation The results for the off-shell signal strength parameters moff-shell F,moff-shell V, and moff-shell, and the H boson width GHare extracted from binned extended maximum likelihood ﬁts over several kinematic distributions following the parametrization in Ref. [15]. In this parametrization, all mass dependencies are absorbed into the distributions for the various terms contributing to the likelihood, and the off-shell signal strength parameters, or GH, are kept mass-independent. Over different data periods and event categories, 117 multidimensional distributions are used in the ﬁt: 42 for off-shell 2 `2ndata (10 867 events), including 18 distributions from the trilepton WZ CR (8541 events), and 18 and 57 for off-shell and on-shell 4 `data (1407 off-shell and 621 on-shell events), respectively. In the 2 `2ndata sample, the value of mZZ Tis required to be greater than 300 GeV. Depending on the number of jets ( Nj), this sample is binned in mZZ Tand pmiss T(Nj<2), or mZZ T,pmiss T, and the
2202.06923v2.pdf|||DVBF 2jet-type kinematic discriminants ( Nj2). For the 4 `samples, the binning is in m4`and MELA discriminants, which are sensitive to differences between the H boson signal and continuum ZZ production, or the interfering amplitudes, or anomalous HVV couplings. These variables are listed in Table II of Ref. [15] for 4 `off-shell data, under ‘Scheme 2’ in Table IV of Ref. [23] for on-shell 2016-2018 data, and in Table 1 of Ref. [15] for on-shell 2015 data. The m4`range is required to be within 105–140 GeV for 4 `on-shell data, or above 220 GeV for 4 `off-shell data. Theoretical uncertainties in the kinematic distributions include the simulation of extra jets (up to 20% depending on Nj), and the quantum chromodynamic (QCD) running scale and parton distribution function (PDF) uncertainties in the cross section calculation (up to 30% and 20%, respectively, depending on the process, and mZZ Torm4`). These are particularly important in the gg process since it cannot be constrained by the trilepton WZ CR. Theory uncertainties also 7 include those associated with the EW corrections to the q q!ZZ and WZ processes, which reach 20% at masses around 1 TeV [31, 32]. Experimental uncertainties include uncertainties in the lepton reconstruction and trigger efﬁ- ciency (typically 1% per lepton), the integrated luminosity (between 1.2% and 2.5%, depending on the data-taking period [33–35]), and the jet energy scale and resolution [36], which affect the counting of jets, as well as the reconstruction of the VBF discriminants.

The two set of results are consistent with statistical ﬂuctuations in the data. The constraint on GHat 95% conﬁdence level corresponds to 7.7 10 23<tH<1.310 21s in H boson lifetime.

Likelihood scans overGHare displayed in the right panel of Fig. 4. These scans always include information from the 4 `on-shell data, and the three cases displayed correspond to adding the 4 `off-shell data alone, the 2 `2noff-shell data alone, or adding both. The steepness of the slope of the log-likelihood curves near moff-shell=0 and GH=0 MeV is caused by the interference terms between the H boson and continuum ZZ production amplitudes that scale withp moff-shellorq GH, respectively. The no off-shell scenario with moff-shell=0, orGH=0 MeV is excluded at a p-value of 0.0003 (3.6 standard deviations). The p-value calculation is checked with pseudoexperiments and the Feldman-Cousins prescription [37]. As described in greater detail in the Methods section, the exclusion is illustrated in Extended Data Fig. 9 through a comparison of the total number of events in each off-shell signal region bin predicted for the ﬁt of the data to the no off-shell scenario, and the best ﬁt. Constraints on GHare stable within 1 MeV (0.1 MeV) for the upper (lower) limits when testing the presence of anomalous HVV couplings.

NosigniﬁcantdeviationsfromtheStandardModel (SM) predictions were found. A probe of fundamental interest to further explore the nature of the Higgs boson is its coupling to the top quark, the heaviest particle in the SM. Indirect measurements of the Yukawa coupling between the Higgs boson and the top quark were made by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations [3], assuming no contribution from unknown particles in the gluon–gluon fusion (ggF) loop. A more direct test of this coupling can be performed through the production of the Higgs boson in associationwithatopquarkpair, t¯tH. Usingaproton–proton( pp)datasetcorrespondingtoanintegrated luminosity of 36.1 0.8 fb 1[9], at a centre-of-mass energyps=13TeV, evidence of this production mode was found
1806.00425v2.pdf|||in 2017 by the ATLAS Collaboration [10], with an observed (expected) signiﬁcance relative to the background-only hypothesis of 4.2 (3.8) standard deviations. Combining data at 7, 8, and 13 TeV, the CMS Collaboration reported an observed (expected) signiﬁcance of 5.2 (4.2) standard deviations [11]. This Letter presents results of the search for the t¯tHprocess and the measurement of the t¯tHproduction cross section using data produced in ppcollisions by the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and recorded with the ATLAS detector. The ATLAS detector is described in detail in Refs. [12, 13]. Compared to Ref. [10], the H! andH!Z Z!4`(`=e;) analyses are updated with the 13 TeV data collected in 2017. Improved lepton and photon reconstruction algorithms [14] and analysis techniques are used. The updated analyses are combined with the H!b¯band multilepton analyses from Refs. [10, 15], the latter targeting Higgs boson decays into WW,H! +  with hadronically and leptonically decaying -leptons, and H!Z Zwithout Z Z!4`. Furthermore, a combination is performed with theresultsbasedon4.5 0.4fb 1and20.30.1fb 1ofppdatarecordedin2011and2012atps=7TeV andps=8TeV respectively [16–20]. A Higgs boson mass corresponding to the measured value of 125.090.24 GeV [21] is assumed everywhere. 2H! In the H! analysis, using a dataset corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 79.8 1.6 fb 1atps=13TeV,eventswithtwoisolatedphotoncandidateswithtransversemomenta 1pTlargerthan35GeV and 25 GeV are selected. Both photons must satisfy the quality requirements discussed in Ref. [6]; the diphoton m invariant mass must be in the range m 2»105 160¼GeV, and the leading (subleading) photon must have pTm > 0.35 (0.25). At least one jet with pT>25GeV and containing a b-hadron, identiﬁedusinga b-taggingalgorithmwithaneﬃciencyof77%[22–24],isrequired. Twosignalregions targeting t¯tHproduction are deﬁned.

The sensitivity of the analysis is improved relative to Ref. [6]. Two dedicated boosted decision trees (BDTs) are trained using the XGB/o.sc/o.sc/s.sc/t.sc package [25] to discriminate the t¯tHsignal from the main background processes. These are non-resonant diphoton production processes, including t¯tproduction together with a photon pair. The background processes also include non- t¯tHHiggs boson production: mainlyassociatedproductionwithasingletopquark tHandggFintheHadregion,and tHandassociated production with a vector boson VH, where V=W;Z, in the Lep region. The t¯tH, ggF, vector-boson fusion (VBF), and VHproduction processes were simulated with P/o.sc/w.sc/h.sc/e.sc/g.sc+P/y.sc/t.sc/h.sc/i.sc/a.sc8 [26–34]. The production of a Higgs boson in association with two b-quarks, b¯bH, and tHwere modelled using M/a.sc/d.sc/g.sc/r.sc/a.sc/p.sc/h.sc5_/a.scMC@NLO +P/y.sc/t.sc/h.sc/i.sc/a.sc8 [35, 36].

The data control regions for the Had and Lep BDT training are chosen with the goaltomaximizetheexpectedsensitivity,whichisaﬀectedbythenumberofeventsinthetrainingsample and background composition. Events with low values of the BDT response are removed: about 85% (97%) of the t¯tHsignal events are selected and about 89% (43%) of the non-resonant background events are rejected in the Had (Lep) region. The remaining events are categorized into four (three) bins in the Had (Lep) region depending on the value of the BDT response. The number and boundaries of the BDT bins are chosen to optimize the expected sensitivity to the t¯tHsignal.

Introduction In 2012, ATLAS and CMS discovered a Higgs boson [1, 2] at the Large Hadron Col- lider(LHC)[3]. ThediscoveryoftheHiggsbosonfilledthelastparticlepredictedbytheStandard Model (SM). At the same time, this discovery opens many questions not solved in the SM. The Higgs sector is the most vulnerable in the SM. 15 parameters out of 19 in the SM are related to the Higgs sector. ATLAS [4] and CMS [5] have measured Higgs boson properties in Run 1, and Run 2. There are several extraordinary achievements during Run2: the observation of the Higgsbosonproductioninassociationwithatopquarks[6,7],theobservationoftheHiggsboson decaying into a pair of bottom quarks [8, 9], the evidence of the interaction between Higgs boson and muon [10, 11], and the evidence of Higgs boson decaying into ℓℓ𝛾[12].

Higgs mass measurement ATLAS measures Higgs boson mass using 𝐻→𝛾𝛾channel which
ATL-PHYS-PROC-2023-080.pdf|||has excellent mass res- olution due to precise photon energy scale and resolution calibrations. However, they were still the dominant systematic uncertainties for the mass measurement in the previous analysis [14]. ATLAS improves the calibration method of the photon energy scale and resolution, in particu- lar, in-situ calibration using 𝑍→𝑒𝑒events providing a significant reduction of the systematic uncertainties [15]. The systematic uncertainty of photon calibration is reduced by a factor of four. The measured Higgs boson mass is 125.17 ±0.11(stat.)±0.09(syst.) GeV in Run 2 dataset and 125.22±0.11(stat.)±0.09(syst.) GeV combined with Run 1 dataset [14]. ATLAS combined mass measurement of 𝐻→𝛾𝛾with that of the 𝐻→𝑍𝑍∗→4ℓwhich provides another best mass measurement because of the excellent lepton energy and momentum calibration [16]. The mass measurement of two channels and their combinations is summarised in the left of Fig- ure 1. All measurements are in good agreement, and the combined Higgs mass is measured to be 125.11±0.09(stat.)±0.06(syst.) GeV. 3. Higgs width measurement ATLAS and CMS measure the Higgs boson total width from off-shell and on-shell signal strength using 𝐻→𝑍𝑍∗decay mode in gluon-fusion (ggF) and VBF processes.

Higgs coupling and cross-section measurements The measurements of couplings between the Higgs boson and the SM particles and non- SM particles are one of the most important Higgs properties measurements because many BSM models indicate the deviations from the SM. ATLAS and CMS measure the couplings in various production and decay modes which covers different couplings in the different phase spaces. The combined measurement of all productions and decay modes provides the most sensitive and com- prehensive information on the couplings. Figure 2 shows the results of coupling measurement using𝜅-framework [21]. ATLAS and CMS have similar precision on the 𝜅parameters, which are coupling strength modifiers normalized by the coupling predicted by the SM. The precision for 𝜅𝑊/𝑍,𝜅𝛾,𝜅𝑔,𝜅𝜏reaches 6-8% level, 𝜅𝑡,𝜅𝑏precision is approximately 10%, 𝜅𝜇precision is 20% and𝜅𝑍𝛾precision is 40% level [22, 23].

The search is performed in ﬁve decay modes: gg, ZZ, W+W ,t+t , and b b. An excess of events is observed above the ex- pected background, with a local signiﬁcance of 5.0 standard deviations, at a mass near 125 GeV, signalling the production of a new particle. The expected signiﬁcance for a standard model Higgs boson of that mass is 5.8 standard deviations. The excess is most signiﬁcant in the two decay modes with the best mass resolution, ggand ZZ; a ﬁt to these signals gives a mass of 125.3 0.4(stat.)0.5(syst.)GeV. The decay to two photons indicates that the new particle is a boson with spin different from one. Submitted to Physics Letters BarXiv:1207.7235v2 [hep-ex] 28 Jan 2013 1 1 Introduction The standard model (SM) of elementary particles provides a remarkably accurate description of results from many accelerator and non-accelerator based experiments. The SM comprises quarks and leptons as the building blocks of matter, and describes their interactions through the exchange of force carriers: the photon for electromagnetic interactions, the W and Z bosons for weak interactions, and the gluons for strong interactions. The electromagnetic and weak interactions are uniﬁed in the electroweak theory. Although the predictions of the SM have been extensively conﬁrmed, the question of how the W and Z gauge bosons acquire mass whilst the photon remains massless is still
1207.7235v2.pdf|||open. Nearly ﬁfty years ago it was proposed [1–6] that spontaneous symmetry breaking in gauge theories could be achieved through the introduction of a scalar ﬁeld. Applying this mechanism to the electroweak theory [7–9] through a complex scalar doublet ﬁeld leads to the generation of the W and Z masses, and to the prediction of the existence of the SM Higgs boson (H). The scalar ﬁeld also gives mass to the fundamental fermions through the Yukawa interaction. The mass mHof the SM Higgs boson is not predicted by theory. However, general considera- tions [10–13] suggest that mHshould be smaller than 1 TeV, while precision electroweak mea- surements imply that mH<152 GeV at 95% conﬁdence level (CL) [14]. Over the past twenty years, direct searches for the Higgs boson have been carried out at the LEP collider, leading to a lower bound of mH>114.4 GeV at 95% CL [15], and at the Tevatron proton-antiproton col- lider, excluding the mass range 162–166 GeV at 95% CL [16] and detecting an excess of events, recently reported in [17–19], in the range 120–135 GeV. The discovery or exclusion of the SM Higgs boson is one of the primary scientiﬁc goals of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [20]. Previous direct searches at the LHC were based on data from proton-proton collisions corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 5 fb 1collected at a centre-of-mass energyps=7 TeV. The CMS experiment excluded at 95% CL a range of masses from 127 to 600 GeV [21]. The ATLAS experiment excluded at 95% CL the ranges 111.4–116.6, 119.4–122.1 and 129.2–541 GeV [22]. Within the remaining allowed mass region, an excess of events near 125 GeV was reported by both experiments. In 2012 the proton-proton centre-of- mass energy was increased to 8 TeV and by the end of June an additional integrated
1207.7235v2.pdf|||luminosity of more than 5 fb 1had been recorded by each of these experiments, thereby enhancing signif- icantly the sensitivity of the search for the Higgs boson. This paper reports the results of a search for the SM Higgs boson using samples collected by the CMS experiment, comprising data recorded atps=7 and 8 TeV. The search is performed in ﬁve decay modes, H !gg, ZZ, W+W ,t+t , and b b, in the low-mass range from 110 up to 160 GeV. In this mass range the Higgs boson production cross section is predicted to have values between 23 (29) and 10 (14) pb atps=7 (8) TeV [23]. The natural width of the SM Higgs boson over the same range is less than 100 MeV and the width of any observed peak would be entirely dominated by instrumental mass resolution. In what follows, `stands for electrons or muons, H!W+W is denoted as H!WW, H!t+t as H!tt, and H!bb as H!bb. For the ﬁnal states ZZ and WW in the low-mass region, one or more of the Z or W bosons is off mass shell. With respect to the published analyses [24–28], most analyses have been re-optimized, incor- porating improvements in reconstruction performance and event selection, and mitigating the more challenging conditions due to the higher LHC intensities in 2012. The new analyses pre- sented herein, of 8 TeV samples, and of 7 TeV samples featuring modiﬁed event selection crite- ria, were performed in a “blind” way: the algorithms and selection procedures were formally approved and ﬁxed before the results from data in the signal region were examined. In the 2 2 The CMS experiment previously published analyses similar but less formal procedures were followed. Within the context of this search for the SM Higgs boson, we report the observation of an excess of events above the
1207.7235v2.pdf|||expected background, consistent with the production of a new particle with mass near 125 GeV. The observed local signiﬁcance is 5.0 standard deviations ( s), compared with an expected signiﬁcance of 5.8 s. The evidence is strongest in the two ﬁnal states with the best mass resolution, namely H !ggwith a signiﬁcance of 4.1 sand H!ZZ (with the Z bosons decaying to electrons or muons) with a signiﬁcance of 3.2 s. The decay to two photons indicates that the new particle is a boson with spin different from one. 2 The CMS experiment The possibility of detection of the SM Higgs boson played a crucial role in the conceptual design of the CMS experiment as a benchmark to test the performance of the detector [29–31]. Since the SM Higgs boson mass is not predicted by theory and its production cross section and natural width vary widely over the allowed mass range, a search was envisaged over a large range of masses and in diverse decay modes: pairs of photons, Z bosons, W bosons, tleptons, and b quarks. Planning in view of the analysis of all these channels ensured a detector capable of observing a Higgs boson over a broad mass range and able to detect most potential signals of new physics. The central feature of the CMS apparatus [32] is a superconducting solenoid of 6 m inter- nal diameter, which provides a magnetic ﬁeld of 3.8 T. Within the ﬁeld volume are a sili- con pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass/scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL). Muons are measured in gas-ionization detec- tors embedded in the steel ﬂux-return yoke. Extensive forward calorimeters complement the coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. Charged particles are tracked within the pseudorapidity range jhj< 2.5, where h= ln[tan(q/2)],
1207.7235v2.pdf|||and qis the polar angle measured from the positive zaxis (along the anti- clockwise beam direction). The silicon pixel tracker comprises 66 million 100 150mm2pixels, arranged in three barrel layers and two disks at each end. The silicon strip tracker, organized in ten barrel layers and twelve disks at each end, comprises 9.3 million strips with pitch be- tween 80 and 180 mm, with a total silicon surface area of 198 m2. The tracker has a track-ﬁnding efﬁciency larger than 99% for muons with transverse momentum pTgreater than 1 GeV and a transverse momentum resolution between 1.5 and 2.5% for charged tracks of pT100 GeV in the central region ( jhj<1.5). Measurements of the impact parameters of charged tracks and secondary vertices are used to identify jets that are likely to contain the hadronisation and decay products of b quarks (“b jets”). A b-jet tagging efﬁciency of more than 50% is achieved with a rejection factor for light-quark jets of 200, as measured in t t events in data [33]. The dimuon mass resolution at the Umass, dominated by instrumental effects, is measured to be 0.6% in the barrel region [34], consistent with the design goal. The ECAL is a ﬁne-grained hermetic calorimeter consisting of 75 848 lead tungstate crystals, arranged in a quasi-projective geometry and distributed in a barrel region ( jhj<1.48) and two endcaps that extend up to jhj=3.0. The front-face cross section of the crystals is 22 22 mm2 in the barrel region and 28.6 28.6 mm2in the endcaps. Preshower detectors consisting of two planes of silicon sensors interleaved with a total of three radiation lengths of lead absorber are located in front of the endcaps. Electromagnetic showers are very narrow in lead tungstate (Moli `ere radius of 21 mm), helping in particle identiﬁcation and in the
1207.7235v2.pdf|||implementation of iso- lation criteria. In the central barrel region the energy resolution of electrons that do not radiate 3 substantially in the tracker material indicates that the resolution of unconverted photons is con- sistent with design goals. For such photons the diphoton mass resolution is 1.1 GeV at a mass of 125 GeV. The HCAL barrel and endcaps are sampling calorimeters consisting of brass and scintillator plates, coveringjhj<3.0. Their thickness varies from 7 to 11 interaction lengths, depending onh; a scintillator “tail catcher” placed outside the coil of the solenoid, just in front of the in- nermost muon detector, extends the instrumented thickness to more than 10 interaction lengths everywhere. Iron forward calorimeters with quartz ﬁbers, read out by photomultipliers, extend the calorimeter coverage up to jhj=5.0. Muons are measured in the range jhj<2.4, with detection planes based on three technologies: drift tubes (jhj<1.2), cathode strip chambers (0.9 <jhj<2.4), and resistive plate chambers (jhj<1.6). The ﬁrst two technologies provide a precise position measurement and trigger whilst the third provides precise timing information as well as a second and independent trig- ger. The muon system consists of four stations in the barrel and endcaps, designed to ensure robust triggering and detection of muons over a large angular range. In the barrel region each muon station consists of twelve drift-tube layers, except for the outermost station, which has eight layers. In the endcaps, each muon station consists of six detection planes. The precision of the r-fmeasurement is 100 mm in the drift tubes and varies from 60 to 140 mm in the cathode strip chambers. The CMS trigger and data acquisition systems ensure that potentially interesting events are recorded with high efﬁciency. The ﬁrst level (L1) trigger, comprising the calorimeter, muon, and global trigger processors, uses coarse-granularity information to select the
1207.7235v2.pdf|||most interesting events in less than 4 ms. The detector data are pipelined to ensure negligible deadtime up to a L1 rate of 100 kHz. After L1 triggering, data are transferred from the readout electronics of all subdetectors, through the readout network, to the high-level-trigger processor farm, which operates ofﬂine-quality reconstruction algorithms to decrease the event rate to around 0.5 kHz, before data storage. The CMS experiment employs a highly distributed computing infrastructure, with a primary Tier-0 centre at CERN, supplemented by seven Tier-1, more than 50 Tier-2, and many Tier- 3 centres at national laboratories and universities throughout the world. The CMS software running on this high-performance computing system executes numerous tasks, including the reconstruction and analysis of the collected data, as well as the generation and detailed detector simulation of Monte Carlo (MC) event samples. 3 Event reconstruction The CMS “particle-ﬂow” event description algorithm [35, 36] is used to reconstruct and identify each single particle with an optimized combination of all subdetector information. In this pro- cess, the identiﬁcation of the particle (photon, electron, muon, charged hadron, neutral hadron) plays an important role in the determination of the particle momentum. The reconstructed par- ticles are henceforth referred to as objects. Jets are reconstructed by clustering the particle-ﬂow objects with the anti-k Talgorithm [37] using a distance parameter of 0.5. Additional selection criteria are applied to each event to remove spurious features originating from isolated noise patterns in certain HCAL regions, and from anomalous signals caused by particles depositing energy in the silicon avalanche photodiodes used in the ECAL barrel region. The average number of pp interactions per LHC 4 3 Event reconstruction bunch crossing is estimated to be about 9 and 19 in the 7 TeV (2011) and 8 TeV (2012) data sets, respectively. Energy from overlapping pp
1207.7235v2.pdf|||interactions (“pileup”), and from the underlying event, is subtracted using the F ASTJETtechnique [38–40], which is based on the calculation of theh-dependent transverse momentum density, evaluated on an event-by-event basis. The jet momentum is determined as the vector sum of all particle momenta in the jet. Jet en- ergy corrections are derived from simulation studies and from in situ measurements using the energy balance of dijet and Z/ g+jet events [41]. These corrections are between 5% and 10% of the true momentum over the entire pTspectrum and detector acceptance. The jet momentum resolution achieved is s(pT)/pT=85%/p pT/GeV4% for central jets. A selection is applied to separate jets originating in the primary interaction from those due to energy deposits as- sociated with pileup. The discrimination is based on the differences in the jet shapes, in the relative multiplicity of charged and neutral components, and in the fraction of transverse mo- mentum carried by the hardest components. Within the tracker acceptance the jet tracks are also required to be consistent with originating at the primary vertex. The missing transverse energy vector is taken as the negative vector sum of all particle trans- verse momenta, and its magnitude is referred to as Emiss T. The typical missing transverse energy resolution is around 0.5pSETGeV [42], where SETis the scalar sum of all particle transverse momenta in GeV. The energy deposited in the ECAL is clustered both with general clustering algorithms [43] and with algorithms that constrain the clusters in handfto the shapes expected from electrons and photons with high pT[44]. These specialised algorithms are used to cluster electromagnetic showers without any hypothesis regarding whether the particle originating from the interac- tion point was a photon or an electron; doing this for electrons from Z !ee events provides a measurement of the photon trigger, reconstruction,
1207.7235v2.pdf|||and identiﬁcation efﬁciencies, as well as of the photon energy scale and resolution. The width of the reconstructed Z resonance is used to quantify the performance of the ECAL, using decays to two electrons whose energies are mea- sured using the ECAL alone, with only their directions being determined from the tracks. In the 7 TeV data set, the dielectron mass resolution at the Z boson mass is 1.56 GeV in the barrel and 2.57 GeV in the endcaps, while in the 8 TeV sample, reconstructed with preliminary calibration constants, the corresponding values are 1.61 and 3.75 GeV. For electrons, the reconstruction combines the clusters in the ECAL and the trajectory in the silicon tracker [45]. Trajectories in the tracker volume are reconstructed using a model of electron energy loss and ﬁtted with a Gaussian sum ﬁlter [46]. The electron momentum is determined from the combination of ECAL and tracker measurements. Muon candidates are reconstructed with two algorithms, one in which the tracks in the silicon detector are matched to segments in the muon chambers, and another in which a combined ﬁt is performed to the signals found in both the silicon tracker and muon systems [43]. The efﬁciency to reconstruct a muon of pT>5 GeV is larger than 95%, while the probability to misidentify a hadron as a muon is below 0.1%. For pT>200 GeV the precision of the mo- mentum measurement improves when the silicon tracker signals are complemented with the information from the muon chambers. Selection based on isolation of lepton and photon objects is used extensively. A requirement is placed on the scalar sum of the transverse momenta of the particles reconstructed within a distance DRmaxof the object, sometimes normalised to the pTof the object. The distance DR is deﬁned as DR=p (Dh)2+ (Df)2, where DhandDfare
1207.7235v2.pdf|||the pseudorapidity and azimuthal angle differences between the particle direction and the object direction. Typically DRmaxis chosen to be 0.3 or 0.4. 5 The measurement of the integrated luminosity in CMS is based on a pixel cluster counting method, which exploits the large number of silicon pixels, and hence their low occupancy in a pp collision [47]. The cross section normalisation is derived from van der Meer scans [48]. The uncertainties in the luminosity measurements are 2.2% and 4.4% for the 7 TeV and 8 TeV data sets, respectively. 4 Searches for the standard model Higgs boson Initial phenomenological discussions of Higgs boson production and decay can be found in Refs. [49–56]. Four main mechanisms are predicted for Higgs boson production in pp colli- sions: the gluon-gluon fusion mechanism, which has the largest cross section, followed in turn by vector-boson fusion (VBF), associated WH and ZH production (VH), and production in as- sociation with top quarks (t tH). The cross sections for the individual production mechanisms and the decay branching fractions, together with their uncertainties, have been computed fol- lowing Refs. [57–101] and are compiled in Refs. [23, 102]. The particular set of sensitive decay modes of the SM Higgs boson depends strongly on mH. The results presented in this paper are based on the ﬁve most sensitive decay modes in the low-mass region: H !gg; H!ZZ followed by ZZ decays to 4 `; H!WW followed by decays to 2 `2n; H!ttfollowed by at least one leptonic tdecay; and H!bb followed by b-quark fragmentation into jets. This list is presented in Table 1 and comprises the full set of decay modes and subchannels, or categories, for which both the 7 and 8 TeV data sets have been analysed. Other lower sensitivity subchannels (t tH, H!bb; W/ZH, H!tt; W/ZH, H!WW!2`2n; H!ZZ!2`2q)
1207.7235v2.pdf|||have also been studied, so far only in the 7 TeV data, and are not included here. Adding these analyses in the combination results in an improvement of 0.1sin the overall expected local signiﬁcance at mH=125 GeV.

Samples of MC events used to represent signal and background are fully simulated using GEANT 4 [103]. The simulations include pileup interactions matching the distribution of the number of such interactions observed in data. The description of the Higgs boson signal is obtained from MC simulation using, for most of the decay modes and production processes, the next-to-leading-order (NLO) matrix-element generator POWHEG [104, 105], interfaced with PYTHIA 6.4 [106]. For the dominant gluon-gluon fusion process, the transverse momentum 6 5 Decay modes with high mass resolution spectrum of the Higgs boson in the 7 TeV MC samples is reweighted to the next-to-next-to- leading-logarithmic (NNLL) + NLO distribution computed with HqT[71, 72, 107] and F E- HIPRO[108, 109], except in the H !ZZ analysis, where the effect is marginal. The agree- ment of the pTspectrum in the simulation at 8 TeV with the NNLL + NLO distribution makes reweighting unnecessary. The improved agreement is
1207.7235v2.pdf|||due to a modiﬁcation in the POWHEG setup recommended in Ref. [102]. The simulation of associated-production signal samples uses PYTHIA and all signal samples for H !bb are made using POWHEG interfaced to HER- WIG++ [110]. Samples used for background studies are generated with PYTHIA ,POWHEG , and MADGRAPH [111], and the normalisations are obtained from the best available NNLO or NLO calculations. The uncertainty in the signal cross section related to the choice of parton distribu- tion functions is determined with the PDF4LHC prescription [96–100]. The overall statistical methodology [112] used in this paper was developed by the CMS and ATLAS Collaborations in the context of the LHC Higgs Combination Group. A more concise summary of CMS usage in the search for a Higgs boson is given in Ref. [21]. The modiﬁed frequentist criterion CL s[113, 114] is used for the calculation of exclusion limits. Systematic uncertainties are incorporated as nuisance parameters and are treated according to the fre- quentist paradigm. The combination of searches requires simultaneous analysis of the data selected by all individual analyses, accounting for all statistical and systematic uncertainties and their correlations. The probability for a background ﬂuctuation to be at least as large as the observed maximum excess is termed the local p-value, and that for an excess anywhere in a speciﬁed mass range the global p-value. This probability can be evaluated by generating sets of simulated data incorporating all correlations between analyses optimized for different Higgs boson masses. The global p-value (for the speciﬁed region) is greater than the local p-value, and this fact is often referred to as the look-elsewhere effect (LEE) [115]. Both the local and global p-values can be expressed as a corresponding number of standard deviations using the one-sided Gaussian tail convention. The magnitude of a possible Higgs boson
1207.7235v2.pdf|||signal is charac- terised by the production cross section times the relevant branching fractions, relative to the SM expectation, denoted s/sSMand referred to as the signal strength. The results presented in this paper are obtained using asymptotic formulae [116], including updates recently introduced in the R OOSTATS package [117]. Figure 1 shows the expected local p-values in the mass range 110–145 GeV for the ﬁve decay modes reported here. The expected signiﬁcance of a SM Higgs boson signal at mH=125 GeV when the ﬁve decay modes are combined is 5.6 s. The highest sensitivity in this mass range is achieved in the ZZ, gg, and WW channels. Because of the excellent mass resolution (1–2 GeV) achieved in the ggand ZZ channels, they play a special role in the low-mass region, where the natural width of the SM Higgs boson is predicted to be a few MeV. The expected signature in these channels is therefore a narrow resonance above background, with a width consistent with the detector resolution. 5 Decay modes with high mass resolution 5.1 H!gg In the H!gganalysis a search is made for a narrow peak in the diphoton invariant mass distribution in the range 110–150 GeV, on a large irreducible background from QCD production of two photons. There is also a reducible background where one or more of the reconstructed photon candidates originate from misidentiﬁcation of jet fragments. Early detailed studies indicated this to be one of the most promising channels in the search for a SM Higgs boson in 5.1 H!gg 7 (GeV)Hm110 115 120 125 130 135 140 145Local p-value -1410-1110-810-510-2101σ1 σ2 σ3 σ4 σ5 σ6 σ7Expected p-values Combined γγ→H ZZ→H WW→H ττ→H bb→HExpected p-values Combined γγ→H ZZ→H WW→H ττ→H bb→HCMS-1 = 8 TeV, L = 5.3 fb s-1 = 7 TeV, L = 5.1 fb

To enhance the sensitivity of the analysis, candidate diphoton events are separated into mutu- ally exclusive categories of different expected signal-to-background ratios, based on the prop- erties of the reconstructed photons and on the presence of two jets satisfying criteria aimed at selecting events in which a Higgs boson is produced through the VBF process. The analysis uses multivariate techniques for the selection and classiﬁcation of the events. As an indepen- dent cross-check, an analysis is also performed that is almost identical to the one described in Ref. [24], using simpler criteria based on the properties of the reconstructed photons to select and classify events. The multivariate analysis achieves 15% higher sensitivity than the cross- check analysis. The reconstructed primary vertex that most probably corresponds to the interaction vertex of the diphoton candidate is identiﬁed using the kinematic properties of the tracks associated with that vertex and their correlation with the diphoton kinematics. In addition, if either of the photons converts and the tracks from the conversion are reconstructed and identiﬁed, the direction of the converted photon contributes to the identiﬁcation of the hard-scattering vertex. More details can be found in Ref. [24]. The event selection requires two photon candidates satisfying pTrequirements and “loose” photon identiﬁcation criteria. These photons must be reconstructed within the ﬁducial region, jhj<2.5, excluding the barrel-endcap transition region, 1.44 <jhj<1.57. A pTthreshold of mgg/3 (mgg/4) is applied to the photon leading (subleading) in pT, where mggis the diphoton invariant mass. Scaling the pTthresholds in this way avoids distortion of the shape of the mgg distribution. In the case of events passing the dijet
1207.7235v2.pdf|||selection, the requirement on the leading photon is increased to mgg/2, further reducing background with negligible loss of signal. Jet selection criteria are applied to the two jets of largest pTin the event within jhj<4.7. The jet selection requirements are optimized using simulated VBF signal and diphoton background events. The pTthresholds for the two jets are 30 and 20 GeV, and their hseparation is required to be greater than 3.5. The dijet invariant mass is required to be greater than 350 and 250 GeV for the 7 and 8 TeV data sets, respectively. The lower dijet invariant mass requirement for the 8 TeV data set reﬂects the fact that for the analysis of that data set, the dijet event category is 8 5 Decay modes with high mass resolution divided into two to increase the search sensitivity. This division creates a second “tight” dijet- tagged category in which the dijet invariant mass must be greater than 500 GeV and both jets must have pT>30 GeV. Two additional selection criteria, relating the dijet to the diphoton system, are applied: the difference between the average pseudorapidity of the two jets and the pseudorapidity of the diphoton system is required to be less than 2.5, and the difference in azimuthal angle between the diphoton system and the dijet system is required to be greater than 2.6 radians. A multivariate regression is used to extract the photon energy and a photon-by-photon estimate of the uncertainty in that measurement. The calibration of the photon energy scale uses the Z boson mass as a reference; ECAL showers coming from electrons in Z !ee events are clustered and reconstructed in exactly the same way as photon showers. The photon selection efﬁciency, energy resolution, and associated systematic uncertainties are estimated from data, using Z ! ee events to
1207.7235v2.pdf|||derive data/simulation correction factors. The jet reconstruction efﬁciency, the efﬁciency to correctly locate the vertex position, and the trigger efﬁciency, together with the corresponding systematic uncertainties, are also evaluated from data. For the multivariate analysis, a boosted decision tree (BDT) [119, 120] is trained to give a high output value (score) for signal-like events and for events with good diphoton invariant mass resolution, based on the following observables: (i) the photon quality determined from elec- tromagnetic shower shape and isolation variables; (ii) the expected mass resolution; (iii) the per-event estimate of the probability of locating the diphoton vertex within 10 mm of its true location along the beam direction; and (iv) kinematic characteristics of the photons and the diphoton system. The kinematic variables are constructed so as to contain no information about the invariant mass of the diphoton system. The diphoton events not satisfying the dijet selec- tion are classiﬁed into ﬁve categories based on the output of the BDT, with category boundaries optimized for sensitivity to a SM Higgs boson. Events in the category with smallest expected signal-to-background ratio are rejected, leaving four categories of events. Dijet-tagged events with BDT scores smaller than the threshold for the fourth category are also rejected. Simu- lation studies indicate that the background in the selected event categories is dominated by the irreducible background from QCD production of two photons and that fewer than 30% of the diphoton events used in the analysis contain one or more misidentiﬁed photons (predomi- nantly from g+jet production). Table 2 shows the expected number of signal events in each event category for a SM Higgs boson (of mH=125 GeV), and the background at mgg=125 GeV, estimated from the ﬁt de- scribed below. The estimated mass resolution is also shown, measured both by seff, half the minimum width
1207.7235v2.pdf|||containing 68% of the signal events, and by the full width at half maximum (FWHM). A large variation in the expected signal-to-background ratio between the categories can be seen, although as a consequence of the optimization of the category boundaries the ex- pected signal signiﬁcances in each category are rather similar. The differences in the relative signal-to-background ratio between the categories are almost independent of mH. The background is estimated from data, without the use of MC simulation, by ﬁtting the dipho- ton invariant mass distribution in each of the categories in a range (100 <mgg<180 GeV) extending slightly above and below that in which the search is performed. The choices of the function used to model the background and of the ﬁt range are made based on a study of the possible bias in the measured signal strength. Polynomial functions are used. The degree is chosen by requiring that the potential bias be at least a factor of 5 smaller than the statistical accuracy of the ﬁt prediction. The required polynomial degree ranges from 3 to 5. A further independent analysis (referred to as the sideband background model) is performed 5.1 H!gg 9 Table 2: Expected numbers of SM Higgs boson events ( mH=125 GeV) and estimated back- ground (at mgg=125 GeV) for all event categories of the 7 and 8 TeV data sets.

In the sideband-background-model and cross-check analyses, the observed local p-values for mH=125 GeV correspond to 4.6 and 3.7 s, respectively. The best-ﬁt signal strength for a SM Higgs boson mass hypothesis of 125 GeV is s/sSM=1.60.4. In order to illustrate, in the mggdistribution, the signiﬁcance given by the statistical methods, it is necessary to take into account the large differences in the expected signal-to-background ra- tios of the event categories shown in Table 2.

[121], where Sand Bare the number of signal and background events, respectively, calculated from the si- multaneous signal-plus-background ﬁt to all categories (with varying overall signal strength) and integrating over a 2 seffwide window, in each category, centred on 125 GeV.

The dashed line shows the expected local p-value for the combined data sets, should a SM Higgs boson exist with mass mH. 5.2 H!ZZ In the H!ZZ!4`decay mode a search is made for a narrow four-lepton mass peak in the presence of a small continuum background. Early detailed studies outlined the promise of this mode over a wide range of Higgs boson masses [122]. Only the search in the range 110–160 GeV is reported here. Since there are differences in the reducible background rates and mass resolu- tions between the subchannels 4e, 4 m, and 2e2 m, they are analysed separately. The background sources include an irreducible four-lepton contribution from direct ZZ production via q q and gluon-gluon processes. Reducible contributions arise from Z +bb and t t production where the ﬁnal states contain two isolated leptons and two b-quark jets producing secondary leptons. Additional background arises from Z +jets and WZ +jets events where jets are misidentiﬁed as leptons. Compared to the analysis reported in Ref. [25], the present analysis employs improved muon reconstruction, improved lepton identiﬁcation and isolation, and a kinematic discrimi- nant exploiting the decay kinematics expected for the signal events. An algorithm to recover ﬁnal-state radiation (FSR) photons has also been deployed. Electrons are required to have pT>7 GeV andjhj<2.5. The corresponding requirements for muons are pT>5 GeV andjhj<2.4. Electrons are selected using a multivariate identiﬁer trained using a sample of W +jets events, and the working point is optimized using Z +jets events. Both muons and electrons are required to be isolated. The combined reconstruction

Muon reconstruction and identiﬁcation efﬁciency for muons with pT<15 GeV is measured using J/ y decays.

Final-state radiation from the leptons is recovered and included in the computation of the lepton-pair invariant mass. The FSR recovery is tuned using simulated samples of ZZ !4` and tested on data samples of Z boson decays to electrons and muons. Photons reconstructed withinjhj<2.4 are considered as possibly due to FSR. The photons must satisfy the following requirements. They must be within DR<0.07 of a muon and have pg T>2 GeV (most photon showers within this distance of an electron having already been automatically clustered with the electron shower); or if their distance from a lepton is in the range 0.07 <DR<0.5, they must
1207.7235v2.pdf|||satisfy pg T>4 GeV, and be isolated within DR=0.3. Such photon candidates are com- bined with the lepton if the resulting three-body invariant mass is less than 100 GeV and closer to the Z boson mass than the mass before the addition of the photon. The event selection requires two pairs of same-ﬂavour, oppositely charged leptons. The pair with invariant mass closest to the Z boson mass is required to have a mass in the range 40– 120 GeV and the other pair is required to have a mass in the range 12–120 GeV. The ZZ back- ground is evaluated from MC simulation studies. Two different approaches are employed to estimate the reducible and instrumental backgrounds from data. Both start by selecting events in a background control region, well separated from the signal region, by relaxing the isolation and identiﬁcation criteria for two same-ﬂavour reconstructed leptons. In the ﬁrst approach, the additional pair of leptons is required to have the same charge (to avoid signal contamination) while in the second, two opposite-charge leptons failing the isolation and identiﬁcation criteria are required. In addition, a control region with three passing leptons and one failing lepton is used to estimate contributions from backgrounds with three prompt leptons and one misiden- tiﬁed lepton. The event rates measured in the background control region are extrapolated to the signal region using the measured probability for a reconstructed lepton to pass the isola- tion and identiﬁcation requirements. This probability is measured in an independent sample. Within uncertainties, comparable background counts in the signal region are estimated by both methods. The number of selected ZZ !4`candidate events in the mass range 110 <m4`<160 GeV, in each of the three ﬁnal states, is given in Table 3, where m4`is the four-lepton invariant mass. The number of predicted background

The m4`distribution is shown in Fig. 4. There is a clear peak at the Z boson mass where the decay Z !4`is reconstructed. This feature of the data is well reproduced by the background estimation. The ﬁgure also shows an excess of events above the expected background around 125 GeV. The total background and the numbers of events observed in the three bins where an excess is seen are also shown in Table 3. The combined signal reconstruction and selection efﬁciency, with respect to the mH=125 GeV generated signal with m``>1 GeV as the only cut, is 18% for the 4e channel, 40% for the 4 mchannel, and 27% for the 2e2 mchannel. The kinematics of the H !ZZ!4`process in its centre-of-mass frame, for a given invariant mass of the four-lepton system, is fully described by ﬁve angles and the invariant masses of the two lepton pairs [123–125]. These seven variables provide signiﬁcant discriminating power between signal and background. The momentum of the ZZ system may further differentiate signal from background, but would introduce dependence on the production mechanism, and on the modelling of the QCD effects, and is therefore not considered here.

The m4`distribution of events satisfying KD>0.5 is shown in the inset in Fig. 4. There are three ﬁnal states and two data sets (7 and 8 TeV), and thus the statistical treatment requires six simultaneous two-dimensional maximum-likelihood ﬁts for each value of mH, in the variables m4`and KD. Systematic uncertainties are evaluated from data for the trigger efﬁciency and for the combined lepton reconstruction, identiﬁcation, and isolation efﬁciencies, as described in [128]. Systematic uncertainties in the energy/momentum calibration and in the energy resolution are estimated from data. Additional systematic uncertainties arise from limited statistical precision in the reducible background control regions. The expected 95% CL upper limit on the signal strength s/sSM, in the background-only hy- pothesis, for the combined 7 and 8 TeV data, falls steeply between 110 and 140 GeV, and has a value of 0.6 at mH=125 GeV. The observed upper limit indicates the presence of a signiﬁcant excess in the range 120 <mH<130 GeV. The local p-value is shown as a function of mHin Fig. 6 for the 7 and 8 TeV data, and for their combination. The minimum local p-value in the data occurs at mH=125.6 GeV and has a signiﬁcance of 3.2 s(expected 3.8 s). The combined best-ﬁt signal strength for a SM Higgs boson mass hypothesis of 125.6 GeV is s/sSM=0.7+0.4  0.3. 6 Decay modes with low mass resolution 6.1 H!WW The decay mode H !WW is highly sensitive to a SM Higgs boson in the mass range around the WW threshold of 160 GeV. With the development of tools for lepton identiﬁcation and Emiss Treconstruction
1207.7235v2.pdf|||optimized for LHC pileup conditions, it is possible to extend the sensitiv- ity down to 120 GeV. This decay mode is analysed by selecting events in which both W bosons decay leptonically, resulting in a signature with two isolated, oppositely charged leptons (elec- trons or muons) and large Emiss Tdue to the undetected neutrinos [129, 130]. A pTthreshold of 20 (10) GeV is applied to the lepton leading (subleading) in pT. The analysis of the 7 TeV data is described in Ref. [26] and remains unchanged, while the 8 TeV analysis was modiﬁed to cope with more difﬁcult conditions induced by the higher pileup of the 2012 data taking. Events are classiﬁed according to the number of jets (0, 1, or 2) with pT>30 GeV and within jhj<4.7 (jhj<5.0 for the 7 TeV data set), and further separated into same-ﬂavour (ee and mm) or different-ﬂavour (e m) categories. Events with more than two jets are rejected. To improve the sensitivity of the analysis, the selection criteria are optimized separately for the different event categories since they are characterised by different dominating backgrounds. The zero-jet e m category has the best signal sensitivity.

The one-jet emand zero-jet same-ﬂavour categories only contribute to the signal sensitivity at the 10% level because of larger backgrounds, from top-quark decays and Drell–Yan production, respectively. Event selection in the two-jet category is optimized for the VBF production mechanism. This category has the highest expected signal-to-background ratio, but its contribution to the overall sensitivity is small owing to the lower cross section relative to inclusive production. The projected Emiss Tvariable [26] is used to reduce the Drell–Yan background arising from events where the Emiss Tvector is aligned with the lepton pT, as well as events with mismeasured Emiss Tassociated with poorly reconstructed leptons and jets. The projected Emiss Tis deﬁned as the transverse component of the Emiss Tvector with respect to the closest lepton direction, if it is closer than p/2 in azimuthal angle, or the full Emiss Totherwise. Since pileup degrades the projected Emiss Tresolution, the minimum of two different projected Emiss Tdeﬁnitions is used: the ﬁrst includes all particle candidates in the event, while the second uses only the charged particle candidates associated with the primary
1207.7235v2.pdf|||vertex. In the 8 TeV analysis, the minimum projected Emiss Tdeﬁned in this way is then required to be above a threshold that varies by cate- gory. For mH>140 GeV, projected Emiss Tis required to be greater than 20 GeV in the e mchannel, and greater than 45 GeV in the same-ﬂavour channels. For mH140 GeV in the same-ﬂavour channels, where it is more difﬁcult to separate the signal from the Drell–Yan background, a multivariate selection is used, combining kinematic and topological variables. In the two-jet category, a simple selection of Emiss T>45 GeV is applied. To further reduce the Drell–Yan back- ground in the same-ﬂavour ﬁnal states, events with a dilepton mass within 15 GeV of the Z boson mass are rejected. The background from low-mass resonances is rejected by requiring a dilepton invariant mass greater than 12 GeV. To suppress the top-quark background, a “top tagging” technique based on soft-muon and b- jet tagging is applied. The ﬁrst method is designed to veto events containing muons from b jets coming from decays of top quarks. The second method uses a b-jet tagging algorithm, which looks within jets for tracks with large impact parameters. The algorithm is applied also in the case of zero-jet events, which may contain low- pTjets below the selection threshold. To reduce 6.2 H!tt 17 the background from WZ production, events with a third lepton passing the identiﬁcation and isolation requirements are rejected. Yields for the dominant backgrounds are estimated using control regions in the data. The W+jets contribution is derived from data using a “tight-loose” sample in which one lepton passes the standard criteria and the other does not, but instead satisﬁes a “loose” set of require- ments. The efﬁciency eloose for a jet that satisﬁes the loose selection to pass the tight selection
1207.7235v2.pdf|||is determined using data from an independent loose lepton-trigger sample dominated by jets. The background contamination is then estimated using the events of the “tight-loose” sample weighted by eloose/(1 eloose). The normalisation of the top-quark background is estimated by counting the number of top-tagged events and applying the corresponding top-tagging efﬁ- ciency. The nonresonant WW contribution is normalised by using events with a dilepton mass larger than 100 GeV, where the Higgs boson signal contamination is negligible, extrapolated to the signal region using simulated samples. The same-ﬂavour Drell–Yan background is nor- malised using the number of events observed with a dilepton mass within 7.5 GeV of the Z boson mass, after subtracting the non-Drell–Yan contribution. Other minor backgrounds from WZ, ZZ, and W gare estimated from simulation. The 7 TeV data are analysed by training a BDT for each Higgs boson mass hypothesis in the zero-jet and one-jet event categories, while a simple selection strategy is employed in the VBF category [26]. In the BDT analysis, the Higgs boson signal is separated from the background by using a binned maximum-likelihood ﬁt to the classiﬁer distribution. The 8 TeV analysis is based on a simple selection strategy optimized for each mass hypothesis, where additional kinematic and topological requirements are applied to improve the signal-to-background ratio. One of the most sensitive variables to discriminate between H !WW decays and nonresonant WW production is the dilepton invariant mass m``. This quantity is shown in Fig. 7 for the zero-jet e m category after the full selection for mH=125 GeV, except for the selection on m``itself. Table 4 shows for the 8 TeV analysis the number of events selected in data, background estimates, and signal predictions for mH= 125 GeV in each analysis category after applying all the selection requirements. About 97% of the signal
1207.7235v2.pdf|||events selected in the zero-jet e mcategory are expected to be produced by the gluon-gluon fusion process, whereas 83% of the signal in the two-jet e m category is expected to be produced by the VBF process. The 95% CL expected and observed limits for the combination of the 7 and 8 TeV analyses are shown in Fig. 8. A broad excess is observed that is consistent with a SM Higgs boson of mass 125 GeV. This is illustrated by the dotted curve in Fig. 8 showing the median expected limit in the presence of a SM Higgs boson with mH=125 GeV. The expected signiﬁcance for a SM Higgs of mass 125 GeV is 2.4 sand the observed signiﬁcance is 1.6 s. 6.2 H!tt The decay mode H !ttis searched for in four exclusive subchannels, corresponding to dif- ferent decays of the tpair: e m,mm, eth, and mth, where electrons and muons arise from leptonic tdecays, and thdenotes hadronic tdecays. The latter are reconstructed by selecting tdecays consistent with the hypothesis of three charged pions, or one charged pion and up to two neu- tral pions [131]. The search is made in the mass range 110–145 GeV, and a signal should appear as a broad excess in the distribution of the t-pair invariant mass mtt. The sensitivity of the search is improved by classifying the events according to jet multiplicity and the transverse momentum of the reconstructed t. The multiplicity of jets with pT>30 GeV reﬂects the production mechanism: events with zero or one jet are likely to come from the gluon-gluon fusion process, while events with two jets are candidates for VBF production. 18 6 Decay modes with low mass resolution Table 4: Observed number of events, background estimates, and signal predictions for mH= 125 GeV in each category

Five independent search channels are explored corresponding to different decays of the vector boson: Z (``)H, Z(nn)H, and W (`n)H. Events are further separated into two categories based on the pTof the vector boson, ranging from 50–100 GeV for the lowest bin in the Z (``)search, to greater than 170 GeV for the highest bin in the W (`n)search. For the Z (nn)search, two subchannels are deﬁned as 120 <Emiss T<160 GeV andEmiss T>160 GeV. The two jets comprising the candidate Higgs boson decay are required to be identiﬁed as b jets, and the dijet system must satisfy a pTthreshold
1207.7235v2.pdf|||that is optimized within each channel: greater than 120 GeV for WH, 160 GeV for Z (nn)H, and no explicit threshold for Z(``)H. Dominant backgrounds arise from production of vector bosons in association with jets, pair- or single-production of top quarks, and diboson production (WW, WZ, ZZ) with one of the bosons decaying hadronically. Signiﬁcant background rejection is achieved in general by requiring large pTfor the dijet, while also requiring that there be minimal additional jet activity and that the vector boson and dijet be back to back in azimuth. The effect on the signal efﬁciency of this selection due to higher-order electroweak [133] and QCD [91] corrections are accounted for in the systematic uncertainties. Further signal discrimination is obtained from the dijet invariant mass, which is expected to peak near mH. A multivariate regression algorithm to better estimate b-jet pTis trained on jets in simulated signal events and achieves a ﬁnal dijet mass resolution of 8–9% for mH=125 GeV. The performance of the regression algorithm is checked in data using W/Z +jets and t t events. A search for the signal is made in the distribution of scores of a BDT trained at discrete mass points. Input variables to the BDT algorithm exploit kinematic and topological information about the vector boson and dijet systems, and the colour-singlet nature of the Higgs boson [134]. The distribution of scores in simulated background events is checked using control regions in the data designed to enrich individual background contributions. Figure 11 shows as an exam- ple the BDT scores for the high- pTsubchannel of the Z (nn)H channel in the 8 TeV data set, after all selection criteria have been applied. The rates for the dominant backgrounds arising from production of W/Z +jets and top-quark pairs are estimated in data [28], while contributions
1207.7235v2.pdf|||from single-top and diboson production are estimated from simulation studies. The signal is then searched for as an excess in the BDT score distribution using the predicted shapes for signal and background events, for Higgs bo- son masses in the range 110–135 GeV. Combined results for expected and observed 95% CL limits obtained from the 7 and 8 TeV data sets are displayed in Fig. 12. The expected and observed limits are 1.6 and 2.1 times the SM Higgs boson cross section at mass 125 GeV.

The combination assumes the relative branching fractions predicted by the SM and takes into account the experimental statis- tical and systematic uncertainties as well as the theoretical uncertainties, which are dominated by the imperfect knowledge of the QCD scale and parton distribution functions.

The largest contributors to the overall excess in the combination are the ggand ZZ decay modes.

Their combined signiﬁcance reaches 26 7 Combined results 5.0s(Fig. 16). The WW decay mode has an exclusion sensitivity comparable to the ggand ZZ decay modes but does not have a good mass resolution.

The excess constitutes the observation of a new particle with a mass near 125 GeV, manifesting itself in decays to two photons or to ZZ. These two decay modes indicate that the new particle is a boson; the two-photon decay implies that its spin is different from one [135, 136]. 7.2 Mass of the observed boson The mass mXof the observed boson is determined using the ggand ZZ decay modes, with the former dominating the precision of the

There are two main sources of systematic uncertainty: (i) imperfect simulation of the differences between electrons and photons and (ii) the need to extrapolate from mZto mX125 GeV. The systematic uncertainties are evaluated by making comparisons between data and simulated samples of Z !ee and H!gg(mH=90 GeV). The two uncertainties, which together amount to 0.5%, are assumed to be fully correlated between all the ggevent categories in the 7 and 8 TeV data. For the ZZ !4`decay mode
1207.7235v2.pdf|||the energy scale (for electrons) and momentum scale (for muons) are calibrated using the leptonic decays of the Z boson, with an assigned uncertainty of 0.4%. Figure 17 shows the two-dimensional 68% CL regions for the signal strength s/sSMversus mX for the three channels (untagged gg, dijet-tagged gg, and ZZ!4`). The combined 68% CL contour shown in Fig. 17 assumes that the relative event yields among the three channels are those expected from the standard model, while the overall signal strength is a free parameter. To extract the value of mXin a model-independent way, the signal yields of the three channels are allowed to vary independently. Thus the expected event yields in these channels are scaled by independent factors, while the signal is assumed to be due to a particle with a unique mass mX. The combined best-ﬁt mass is mX=125.30.4(stat.)0.5(syst.)GeV. 7.3 Compatibility with the SM Higgs boson hypothesis A ﬁrst test of the compatibility of the observed boson with the SM Higgs boson is provided by examination of the best-ﬁt value for the common signal strength s/sSM, obtained in a com- bination of all search channels. Figure 18 shows a scan of the overall s/sSMobtained in the combination of all channels versus a hypothesised Higgs boson mass mH. The band corre- sponds to the1suncertainty (statistical and systematic). The excesses seen in the 7 TeV and 8 TeV data, and in their combination, around 125 GeV are consistent with unity within the 1s uncertainties. The observed s/sSMvalue for an excess at 125.5 GeV in a combination of all data is 0.870.23. The different decay channels and data sets have been examined for self- consistency.

The search is performed in ﬁve decay modes: gg, ZZ, W+W ,t+t , and b b. An excess of events is observed above the expected background, with a local signiﬁcance of 5.0 s, at a mass near 125 GeV, signalling the production of a new particle. The expected local signiﬁcance for a standard model Higgs boson of that mass is 5.8 s. The global p-value in the search range of 115–130 (110–145) GeV corresponds to 4.6 s(4.5s). The excess is most signiﬁcant in the two decay modes with the best mass resolution, ggand ZZ, and a ﬁt to these signals gives a mass of 125.30.4(stat.)0.5(syst.)GeV. The decay to two photons indicates that the new parti- cle is a boson with spin different from one. The results presented here are consistent, within uncertainties, with expectations for a standard model Higgs boson. The collection of further data will enable a more rigorous test of this conclusion and an investigation of whether the properties of the new particle imply physics beyond the standard model. 29 (GeV)Xm123 124 125 126 127 128 129SMσ/σ 0123456 Combined (untagged)γγ→H (VBF tag)γγ→H ZZ→HCMS-1 = 8 TeV, L = 5.3 fb s-1 = 7 TeV, L = 5.1 fb s ZZ→ + H γγ→ H Figure 17: The 68% CL contours for the signal strength s/sSMversus the boson mass mXfor the untagged gg,ggwith VBF-like dijet, 4 `, and their combination.

Tests of its spin and CP quantum numbers strongly indicate that the observed particle is of scalar nature and that the dominant coupling structure is CP-even, consistent with the Standard Model (SM) expectation [6–8]. The measurements of the Higgs boson production and diﬀerential cross-sections, branching ratios, and the 2 derived constraints on coupling-strength modiﬁers, assuming the SM coupling structure, have also shown no signiﬁcant deviation from the predictions for the SM Higgs boson with a mass of 125 GeV[9–12]. Furthermore, constraints have been set on various coupling parameters beyond the SM (BSM) that modify the tensor structure of the Higgs boson couplings to SM particles [8, 13–20].

Thenumberofproductionbinsislimitedtoavoidlossofmeasurementsensitivityfora given amount of integrated luminosity. The deﬁnitions of the production bins used for this measurement are shown in the left panel of Fig- ure 1 (shaded area). All production bins are deﬁned for Higgs bosons with rapidity j𝑦𝐻j2.5 and no 3 requirement is placed on the particle-level leptons. Two sets of production bins with diﬀerent granularity are considered, as a trade-oﬀ between statistical and theoretical uncertainties. The ﬁrst set of production bins (Production Mode Stage) [24] is deﬁned according to the Higgs boson production modes: gluon–gluon fusion ( ggF), vector-boson fusion ( VBF) and associated production with vector bosons ( VH, where𝑉=𝑊or𝑍) or top quark pairs ( 𝑡𝑡𝐻). Since𝑏-jets from𝑏𝑏𝐻associated production are emitted at small angles relative to the beam axis and usually outside of the detector acceptance, the 𝑏𝑏𝐻andggFHiggs boson production modes have similar signatures and acceptances. Their contributions are considered together with their relative ratio ﬁxed to the SM prediction. In the following, the sum of their contributions is referred to as ggF. Similarly, single top production ( tH) is considered together with 𝑡𝑡𝐻, with their relative ratio ﬁxed to the SM prediction. In contrast to the Stage-0 production bins described in Ref. [24], the VHevents with hadronic decays of the vector boson 𝑉are includedinthe VHproductionbinratherthaninthe ggForVBFbins. Inthisway,eachofthefourmain Higgs boson production modes can be measured separately. The second set of
2004.03447v3.pdf|||production bins (Reduced Stage 1.1) is more exclusive than the ﬁrst one. Starting from the production bins of a more granular Stage 1.1 set [25], several production bins are merged as the full set of bins cannot be measured separately in the 𝐻!𝑍𝑍!4ℓchannel with the current data sample. The deﬁnitions of the bins are based on the multiplicity of particle-level jets, the Higgs boson transverse momentum 𝑝𝐻 Tand the invariant mass 𝑚𝑗𝑗of the two jets with the highest transverse momentum. Particle-level jets are built from all stable particles (particles with lifetime c 𝜏 ¡10 mm) including neutrinos, photons, and leptons from hadron decays or those produced in the parton shower. The anti-𝑘𝑡jet reconstruction algorithm [26, 27] with a radius parameter 𝑅=04is used. All Higgs boson decay products, as well as the leptons and neutrinos from the decays of the associated 𝑉bosons are excluded from the jet building, while the decay products from hadronically decaying associated 𝑉bosons, are included. The jets are required to have 𝑝T¡30 GeV, with no restrictions on rapidity. Events from ggFproduction and 𝑔𝑔!𝑍𝐻production with a hadronically decaying 𝑍boson are split into seven common production bins. Six bins have a Higgs boson transverse momentum below 200 GeV, while theseventhbinwithHiggsbosontransversemomentumabove200 GeV(gg2H-𝑝𝐻 T-High)issensitiveto contributions from BSM physics. For 𝑝𝐻 Tbelow 200 GeV, further splits are made according to the jet multiplicity and 𝑝𝐻 T. Events with no jets are split into two bins with 𝑝𝐻 Tbelow and above 10 GeV. Events with one jet are split into three bins with 𝑝𝐻 Tbelow 60 GeV, between 60 GeVand 120GeV, and above 120GeV. Finally, Higgs boson events with two or more jets are combined into one bin. The bins are respectively denoted by gg2H-0𝑗-𝑝𝐻 T-Low,gg2H-0𝑗-𝑝𝐻 T-High,gg2H-1𝑗-𝑝𝐻 T-Low,gg2H-1𝑗-𝑝𝐻 T-Med, gg2H-1𝑗-𝑝𝐻 T-Highandgg2H-2𝑗. As described in Ref.

In order to probe for possible non-SM contributions to the tensor structure of the Higgs boson couplings, the measured simpliﬁed template cross-sections are interpreted using an EFT approach.

Only dimension-six operators are considered for this paper, since the dimension-ﬁve and dimension-seven operators violate lepton and baryon number conservation and the impact of higher-dimensional operators is expected to be suppressed by more powers of the cutoﬀ scaleΛ[28]. For energies less than the scale of new physics, only the ratio 𝑐𝑖=𝐶¹𝑑=6º 𝑖Λ2can be constrained by the data. 6 ConstraintsaresetontheWilsoncoeﬃcientsdeﬁnedwithintheStandardModelEﬀectiveFieldTheory (SMEFT)formalism[29]intheWarsawbasis [30]. Themeasurementsinthe 𝐻!𝑍𝑍!4ℓchannel do not provide sensitivity for simultaneous constraints on the full set of these coeﬃcients. To reduce the number of relevant parameters, a minimal ﬂavour-violating scenario is assumed and only operators aﬀecting the Higgs boson cross-section at tree level are considered. Operators aﬀecting only double Higgs boson production and those aﬀecting the Higgs boson couplings to down-type quarks and leptons are neglected due to limited sensitivity. The impact of these operators on the total Higgs boson decay width is alsoneglected. Theremainingtenoperators(seeTable1)compriseﬁveCP-evenandﬁveCP-oddones.

For that purpose, the corresponding expected signal production cross-sections, the branching ratio and the signal acceptances are parameterised in terms of the Wilson coeﬃcients.

Theendcapandforwardregions areinstrumentedupto j𝜂j=49withLArcalorimetersforboththeEMandhadronicenergymeasurements. The calorimeters are surrounded by the MS and three large air-core toroidal superconducting magnets with eight coils each. The ﬁeld integral of the toroid magnets ranges between 2.0and6.0Tm across most of the detector. The MS includes a system of precision tracking chambers and fast detectors for triggering, covering the region j𝜂j27. Events are selected using a ﬁrst-level trigger implemented in custom electronics, which reduces the event rate to a maximum of 100kHz using a subset of detector information. Softwarealgorithmswithaccesstothefulldetectorinformationarethenusedinthehigh-level trigger to yield a recorded event rate of about 1 kHz [35]. 1ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the centre of the detector and the𝑧-axis along the beam pipe. The 𝑥-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the 𝑦-axis points upwards. Cylindrical coordinates ¹𝑟𝜙ºare used in the transverse plane, 𝜙being the azimuthal angle around the 𝑧-axis. The pseudorapidity is deﬁned in terms of the polar angle 𝜃as𝜂= ln tan¹𝜃2º.

Electron candidates are reconstructed from energy clusters in the electromagnetic calorimeter that are matched to ID tracks [129]. A Gaussian-sum ﬁlter algorithm [130] is used to compensate for radiative energy losses in the ID for the track reconstruction, while a dynamical, topological cell-based approach for clusterbuildingisusedtoimprovetheenergyresolutionrelativetothepreviousmeasurementsinRefs.[17, 128], in particular for the case of bremsstrahlung photons. Electron identiﬁcation is based on a

The ‘loose’ likelihood criteria, applied in combination with track hit requirements, provide an electron reconstruction and identiﬁcation eﬃciency of atleast90%forisolatedelectronswith 𝑝T¡30GeVand85%–90%below[129]. Electronsarerequiredto have𝐸T¡7GeVand pseudorapidity j𝜂j2.47, with their energy calibrated as described in Ref. [129]. Muon candidate reconstruction [131] within the range j𝜂j25is primarily performed by a global ﬁt to fully reconstructed tracks in the ID and the MS, with a ‘loose’ [131] identiﬁcation criterion applied. This criterion has an eﬃciency of at least 98% for isolated muons with 𝑝T=5GeVand rises to 99.5% at higher𝑝T. At the centre of the detector ( j𝜂j0.1), which has a reduced MS geometrical coverage, muonsarealsoidentiﬁedbymatchingafullyreconstructedIDtracktoeitheranMStracksegmentora calorimeter energy deposit consistent with a minimum-ionising particle (calorimeter-tagged muons). For these two cases, the muon momentum is measured from the ID track alone. In the forward MS region (2.5j𝜂j2.7), outside the full ID coverage, MS tracks with hits in the three MS layers are accepted and combined with forward ID tracklets, if they exist (stand-alone muons). Calorimeter-tagged muons are required to have 𝑝T¡15GeV. For all other muon candidates, the transverse momentum is required to be greaterthan5 GeV.

Events were triggered by a combination ofsingle-lepton,dileptonandtrileptontriggerswithdiﬀerenttransversemomentumthresholds. Single- lepton triggers with the lowest thresholds had strict identiﬁcation and isolation requirements. Both the high-thresholdsingle-leptontriggersandthemultileptontriggershadlooserselectioncriteria. Duetoan increasing peak luminosity, these thresholds increased slightlyduring the data-taking periods [142, 143]. For single-muon triggers, the 𝑝Tthreshold ranged from between 20 and 26 GeV, while for single-electron triggers,the𝑝Tthresholdrangedfrom24to26 GeV. Theglobaltriggereﬃciencyforsignaleventspassing the ﬁnal selection is about 98%. In the analysis, at least two same-ﬂavour and opposite-charge lepton pairs (hereafter referred to as lepton pairs) are required in the ﬁnal state, resulting in one or more possible lepton quadruplets in each event.

While for the previous analyses [17, 128], simulation was exclusively used to estimate both the shape and normalisation, in this analysis the normalisation is constrained by a data-driven technique. This allows the systematic uncertainty to be reduced by removing both the theoretical and luminosity uncertainties contributing to the normalisation uncertainty. As outlined in Section 5.1, to estimate the normalisation, sideband categories in the 𝑚4ℓmass region 105–115GeVand 130–160 GeVare deﬁned according to the jet multiplicity (SB- 0𝑗, SB- 1𝑗, SB- 2𝑗). The normalisation of the 𝑍𝑍background is simultaneously ﬁtted with a common normalisation factor for signal region and sideband categories with the same jet multiplicity. For example, the 𝑍𝑍background is scaledbya commonfactorfor 2𝑗,2𝑗-BSM-likeandSB- 2𝑗categories. Thebackground shapetemplates forNNdiscriminants and the expected fraction of events in relevant reconstructed signal-region event categories are obtained from simulation. As shown in Figure 4(a), good agreement is found between data and simulation for the shape of the NN observable.

The impact of the theory systematic uncertainties on the signal depends on the kind of measurement that is performed. Forsignal-strengthmeasurements,deﬁnedasthemeasuredcross-sectiondividedbytheSM prediction,orinterpretationofcross-sectionusingtheEFTapproach,eachsourceoftheoryuncertainty aﬀects both the acceptance and the predicted SM cross-section. For the cross-section measurements, only eﬀects on the acceptance need to be considered. The impact of the theory systematic uncertainties on the background depends on the method of estimating the normalisation. If simulation is used, the uncertainties in the acceptance and the predicted SM cross-sectionareincluded. Ifthenormalisationisestimatedfromadata-drivenmethod,onlytheimpacton the relative event fractions between categories is considered. One of the dominant sources of theoretical uncertainty is the prediction of the ggFprocess in the diﬀerent 𝑁jetscategories. The ggFprocess gives a large contribution in categories with at least two jets. To estimate the variations due to the impact of higher-order contributions not included in the calculations and migration eﬀects on the 𝑁jetsggFcross-sections, the approach described in Refs. [24, 161] is used, which exploitsthelatestpredictionsfortheinclusivejetcross-sections. Inparticular,theuncertaintyfromthe choiceoffactorisationandrenormalisationscales,thechoiceofresummationscales,andthemigrations between the 0-jet and 1-jet phase-space bins or between the 1-jet and 2-jet bins are considered [24, 162–164]. The impact of QCD scale variations on the Higgs boson 𝑝Tdistribution is taken into account as anadditionaluncertainty. Theuncertaintyinhigher-ordercorrectionstotheHiggsboson 𝑝Toriginating from the assumption of inﬁnite top quark mass in the heavy-quark loop is also taken into account by comparing the 𝑝Tdistribution predictions to ﬁnite-mass calculations. An additional uncertainty in the acceptance of the ggFprocess in VBFtopologies [165] due to missing higher orders in QCD in the calculation is estimated by variations of the renormalisation and factorisation scales using ﬁxed-order calculations with MCFM [166]. An additional uncertainty in the Higgs boson 𝑝Tdistribution, derived by varyingtherenormalisation,factorisationandNNLOPSscaleinthesimulation,inthe0-jettopologyis considered. This
2004.03447v3.pdf|||is particularly relevant when measuring the inclusive ggFcross-section using the 𝑝4ℓ T categories for events with no jet activity. To account for higher-order corrections to 𝑝𝐻𝑗𝑗 T, which is used as anNNinputvariable,theuncertaintyisderivedbycomparingthepredicteddistributionobtainedusing P/o.pc/w.pc/h.pc/e.pc/g.pc NNLOPS andM/a.pc/d.pcG/r.pc/a.pc/p.pc/h.pc5 _aMC@NLO with the FxFx merging scheme. For the VBFproduction mode, the uncertainty due to missing higher orders in QCD is parameterised using the scheme outlined in Ref. [23]. The migration eﬀects due to the selection criteria imposed on the numberofjets,transversemomentumoftheHiggsboson,transversemomentumoftheHiggsbosonand the leading dĳet system and the invariant mass of the two leading jets, used to deﬁne the full Stage 1.1 STXS production bins, are computed by varying the renormalisation and factorisation scales by a factor of two. Theuncertaintiesarecross-checkedwithﬁxed-ordercalculations. Similarly,forthe VHproduction mode with the associated 𝑉decaying leptonically, the scale variations are parameterised as migration 27 eﬀects due to the selection criteria imposed on the number of jets and the transverse momentum of the associated boson [167]. FortheVHproductionmodewiththeassociated 𝑉decayinghadronicallyandthe 𝑡𝑡𝐻productionmode, the uncertainty due to missing higher orders in QCD is obtained by varying the renormalisation and factorisation scales by a factor of two. The conﬁguration with the largest impact, as quantiﬁed by the relative diﬀerence between the varied and the nominal conﬁguration, is chosen to deﬁne the uncertainty in eachexperimentalcategory. Theseuncertaintiesaretreatedasuncorrelatedamongthediﬀerentproduction modes. Duetothelimitedaccuracyofthesimulatedsamples,theuncertaintiesevaluatedusingthismethod for the total cross-sections are larger than those described in Ref. [24]. The uncertainties in the acceptance due to the modelling of parton showers and the underlying event are estimated with AZNLO tune eigenvector variations and by comparing the acceptance using the partonshoweringalgorithmfrom P/y.pc/t.pc/h.pc/i.pc/a.pc8withthatfrom H/e.pc/r.pc/w.pc/i.pc/g.pc7[168]forallsignalprocesses. The uncertaintyduetoeachAZNLOtunevariationistakenascorrelatedamongthediﬀerentproductionmodes while the diﬀerence between the parton showering algorithms is treated as an uncorrelated uncertainty. The uncertainties due to higher-order corrections to the Higgs boson decay are modelled using the PROPHECY4F [102,105]and H/t.pc/o.pc4L[104,169]generators. Thesecorrectionsarebelow2%andhave a negligible impact on the results. A 100% uncertainty is assigned to heavy-ﬂavour quark

TheimpactofthePDFuncertaintyisestimatedwiththethirtyeigenvectorvariationsofthe PDF4LHC_/n.pc/l.pc/o.pc_30 Hessian PDF set following the PDF4LHC recommendations [40]. The modiﬁcation of the predictions originating from each eigenvector variation is added as a separate source of uncertainty in the model. The same procedure is applied for the ggF,VBF,VHand𝑡𝑡𝐻processes, enabling correlations to be taken into account in the ﬁt model. The impacts of the theoretical uncertainties, as described above, on the shape of NN discriminants are alsoconsidered. For ggFproduction,afurthercross-checkisperformedbycomparingtheNNshapesin thecorrespondingcategories aspredictedby P/o.pc/w.pc/h.pc/e.pc/g.pc NNLOPS andM/a.pc/d.pcG/r.pc/a.pc/p.pc/h.pc5_/a.pcMC@NLO withthe FxFxmergingscheme. AlltheNNshapes fromthetwogeneratorsagreewithinthe scalevariationsand, therefore, no additional shape uncertainty is included. For signal-strength measurements, an additional uncertainty related to the 𝐻!𝑍𝑍branching ratio prediction [102, 105] is included in the measurement. Since the normalisation of the 𝑍𝑍process in most reconstructed event categories is constrained by performingasimultaneousﬁttosidebandregionsenrichedinthiscontributiontogetherwiththesignal regions,mostofthetheoreticaluncertaintyinthenormalisationforthisbackgroundvanishes. Nevertheless, uncertainties in the shapes of the discriminants for the 𝑍𝑍background and in the relative contribution of thisbackgroundbetweenthesidebandsandthesignalregionsaretakenintoaccount. Theuncertainties due to missing higher-order eﬀects in QCD are estimated by varying the factorisation and renormalisation QCD scales by a factor of two; the impact of the PDF uncertainty is estimated by using the MC replicas of theNNPDF3.0 PDF set. Uncertainties due to parton shower modelling for the 𝑍𝑍process are considered aswell. Theimpactoftheseuncertaintiesisbelow2%forallproductionmodecross-sectionsmeasured. In addition, a comparison between S/h.pc/e.pc/r.pc/p.pc/a.pcandP/o.pc/w.pc/h.pc/e.pc/g.pcis also taken as an additional source of systematic uncertainty. This model uncertainty is treated as uncorrelated among the diﬀerent sideband-to-signal region extrapolations (in 0-jet, 1-jet and 2-jet categories). 28 The uncertainty in the gluon-initiated and the vector-boson-initiated 𝑍𝑍process is taken into account by changing the relative composition of the quark-initiated, the gluon-initiated and the vector-boson- scattered𝑍𝑍components according to the theoretical uncertainty in the predicted cross-sections and therespective 𝐾-factors.

For thetXXprocess, uncertainties due to PDF and QCD scale variations are considered in the relative fraction of events present in the 𝑡𝑡𝐻-like categories, in the SB- 𝑡𝑋𝑋-enriched control region and in the NN discriminant shape. Diﬀerences between M/a.pc/d.pcG/r.pc/a.pc/p.pc/h.pc5 _aMC@NLO and S/h.pc/e.pc/r.pc/p.pc/a.pcare considered as an additional systematic uncertainty. For all other categories where this process is estimated from simulation, the impact of these uncertainties on the SM cross-section and acceptance are also considered.

Anassumption is madethat higher-ordercorrections,appliedinamultiplicativeway,arethesameforboththeSMandtheBSMLO predictions and therefore no changes in the parameterisation are expected due to higher-order eﬀects [171]. With the current amount of data, the constraints from the VBF,VHand𝑡𝑡𝐻production modes on the relevant Wilson coeﬃcients still allow a rather large range of parameter values in which the quadratic term (the last term in Eq. (1)) cannot be neglected even though its contribution is suppressed by Λ4. Such dimension-six quadratic terms are therefore included in the EFT parameterisation. Since the linear terms from dimension-eight operators are suppressed by the same factor, they could in general also give similar non-negligible contributions. Dimension-eight terms are currently not available in the SMEFT model and are thus not taken into account.

Other decay modes are not aﬀected by the probed Wilson coeﬃcients. Their contribution to the total decay width is therefore given by the corresponding SM predictions.

The ‘V’-shaped correlation between the 𝑐𝐻𝐺and𝑐𝐻𝐵parameters is due to the interplay between the EFTparameterisationinthe ggFproductionvertexandtheparameterisationofthebranchingratiosand acceptances. The ggFproductionvertexprovidestheconstraintonthe 𝑐𝐻𝐺parameteralone,independently of𝑐𝐻𝐵. Due tothe decay vertexwith its acceptance corrections,this constrained range isshifted upward with increasing values of 𝑐𝐻𝐵. Close to the SM point, the constrained 𝑐𝐻𝐺range remains approximately the same as without the decay constraints. An additional constraint on 𝑐𝐻𝐵is provided by the VBF production mode. Around the SM point, the 𝑐𝐻𝐵constraints correspond approximately to those
2004.03447v3.pdf|||from theone-dimensionalparameterﬁt. Additionalsensitivitytointermediatevaluesofthe 𝑐𝐻𝐵parameteris provided by the acceptance corrections, resulting in two additional allowed parameter regions that are disjoint from the region around the SM point. Similar arguments hold also for the CP-odd case with the𝑐𝐻e𝐺and𝑐𝐻e𝐵parameters. As opposed to the CP-even case, however, the likelihood contours are symmetric around the 𝑐𝐻e𝐺=0axis, since there are no linear terms contributing to the ggFproduction 47 cross-section. Thecorrelationbetweenthe 𝑐𝐻𝐺and𝑐𝑢𝐻(𝑐𝐻e𝐺and𝑐e𝑢𝐻)parametersisintroducedthroughtheinterference term in the𝑡𝑡𝐻vertex. However, the impact of this term on the ﬁnal result is negligible since the 𝑐𝐻𝐺 (𝑐𝐻e𝐺) parameter is already constrained to very small values compared with 𝑐𝑢𝐻(𝑐e𝑢𝐻). Therefore, the 𝑡𝑡𝐻production vertex mainly constrains the 𝑐𝑢𝐻and𝑐e𝑢𝐻parameters, while the ggFvertex constrains only the other two. The acceptance correction has no impact on these results. The CP-odd parameter range is less constrained than the CP-even one due to the missing linear 𝑐e𝑢𝐻terms in the cross-section parameterisation. 11 Conclusion Higgs boson properties are studied in the four-lepton decay channel using 139fb 1of LHC proton–proton collision data atp𝑠=13TeVcollected by the ATLAS experiment.

Gauge theories require in fact thatgaugebosonsbemassless,inapparentcontradictionwithobservations. Inthiscontext,theseminal work ofBrout, Englert [3], Higgs [4–6] andGuralnik, Hagen and Kibble[7, 8], has provided aconsistent mechanism for the generation of gauge boson masses. The Glashow-Weinberg-Salam theory extended this mechanismproposingatheoryoftheelectroweakinteractions[9–11],introducingadoubletofcomplex scalar fields, which couples also to fermions, providing them with a mass that would otherwise be absent. This forms a major component of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. A salient prediction of the SM is the presence of a Higgs boson, whose mass is not predicted by the theory and needs to be estimatedexperimentally. SincetheHiggsbosondiscovery,thankstotheluminosityaccumulatedatthe LHC between 2015 and 2018 (Run 2) and the increased center-of-mass energy at√𝑠= 13TeV, the focus hasshiftedtotheprecisemeasurementsofHiggsbosonproperties[12,13].

This motivatesitsprecisemeasurementthroughdecaychannelsthatcanbefullyreconstructedandwiththebest mass resolution. The𝐻→𝛾𝛾and𝐻→𝑍𝑍∗→4ℓdecays are the most suitable processes to measure 𝑚𝐻at the LHC due to their excellent mass resolution, which produce a clear mass peak above a continuum background [1, 2].

More recently, the CMS Collaboration has measured 𝑚𝐻inthesamedecaychannelsusing35.9 fb−1of13TeV𝑝𝑝Run2collisiondata. Thecombinationof the two CMS Run 2 measurements with their Run 1 results yielded a 𝑚𝐻value of 125.38±0.14GeV [15].

Thecombinedmeasurementsprofitfromtheincreaseddataset,andfromsignificantlyimprovedcalibrations of the electron and photon energy [16, 21] and of the muon momentum [17, 22]. The mass measurement reported in this letter is performed using the profile likelihood ratio [23, 24] defined asΛ(𝑚𝐻)=L(𝑚𝐻,ˆˆ𝜃𝜃𝜃(𝑚𝐻))/L( ˆ𝑚𝐻,ˆ𝜃𝜃𝜃).ˆ𝑚𝐻andˆ𝜃𝜃𝜃are the values of the parameter of interest and nuisance parameters (NP) that maximize the likelihood L(𝑚𝐻,𝜃𝜃𝜃), whileˆˆ𝜃𝜃𝜃(𝑚𝐻)corresponds to the values of the NP that maximize the likelihood for a given value of 𝑚𝐻. Systematic uncertainties are modelled by constrainedNP, whilethe signaland background normalizations inthe variouschannelsenteringthe fitare treated as free parameters. The confidence intervals are obtained assuming the asymptotic distribution of the−2 lnΛ(𝑚𝐻)test statistic [24]. The statistical uncertainty on 𝑚𝐻is estimated by fixing all the NP that areassociatedwithsystematicuncertaintiestotheirbest-fitvaluesandleavingalltheremainingparameters unconstrained. Thetotalsystematicuncertainty,whosesquaredvalueisevaluatedasthedifferencebetween the squares of the total uncertainty and the statistical uncertainty, can be decomposed into categories representing distinct sources of uncertainty by setting all relevant subsets of NP to their best-fit values. The full description of the Run 2 mass measurement in the 𝐻→𝛾𝛾channel is given in Ref. [16]. A descriptionofthekeyaspectsofthismeasurementissummarizedhere. The 𝐻→𝛾𝛾decayisreconstructed by requiring two energetic photons fulfilling strict identification and isolation criteria. The invariant 2 mass𝑚𝛾𝛾distributionoftheselectedphotonpairsexhibitsapeaknear 𝑚𝐻,arisingfromresonantHiggs boson decays, over a smoothly falling distribution from background processes mainly due to non-resonant diphoton production. The value of 𝑚𝐻is determined from the position of the peak in data through a profile-likelihood fit

Simulated signal and background event samples are used tooptimizetheanalysiscriteria,tochoosethesignalandbackground 𝑚𝛾𝛾modelsusedinthefit,andto estimate some of the systematic uncertainties on 𝑚𝐻. To increase the sensitivity of the measurement, the selected events are classified into 14 mutually exclusive categories with different diphoton invariant mass resolutions and signal-to-background ratios, which are analyzed simultaneously. The normalization factor for each category is independent and fitted to the data. The 𝑚𝛾𝛾resolution ranges from about 1.1 GeVto 2.0GeV, depending on the category. The signal model consists of a double-sided Crystal Ball probability densityfunction[25],withthemeanandstandarddeviationofitsGaussiancoreparameterizedasafunction of𝑚𝐻ineachcategoryusingsimulatedsignaleventsgeneratedatdifferent 𝑚𝐻hypotheses. Compared withthemassresultreportedinRef.[19],the 𝐻→𝛾𝛾massmeasurementusedinthiscombinationand reportedinRef.[16]profitsfromanincreaseddatasample,anewphotonreconstructionalgorithmwith better energy resolution [26], an improved estimation of the photon energy scale with significantly reduced uncertainties [21], and an optimized event classification strategy. Uncertainties for photons converting into electron-positron pairs beforereaching the electromagnetic calorimeter, which areexperimentally similar toelectrons,areonlymoderatelyimprovedbytheupdatedcalibrationsatenergiestypicallyobservedin the𝐻→𝛾𝛾decay(e.g.𝐸T∼60GeV). Forunconvertedphotons,theenergycalibrationisimprovedby typically30% inthe centralpartof thecalorimeter ( |𝜂|<1.37), andupto afactor 2inthe endcapregion (1.51≤|𝜂|<2.37). Thereductionoftheuncertaintiesonthephotonenergyscalearisesfromanimproved understanding of the difference in data and simulation of the inputs to the photon energy scale regression, and of the introduction of transverse energy ( 𝐸T) dependent in-situscales derived from 𝑍→𝑒+𝑒−events, that reduce the calibration extrapolation uncertainties from the 𝑍boson mass to the Higgs mass and from electrons to photons [21]. The measured mass of the Higgs boson in the 𝐻→𝛾𝛾final state using the fullRun2datasetis 𝑚𝐻=125.17±0.11(stat.)±0.09(syst.)=125.17±0.14 GeV[16]. Thedominant sources of systematic uncertainties on the measurement are associated to the 𝑍→𝑒+𝑒−in-situscale (59MeV), the residual 𝐸T-dependent electron energy scale calibration (44 MeV), and the calibration extrapolationfromelectronstophotons(30 MeV)[16].

Theselectedquadrupletsare separated into four sub-channels according to the flavor of the leading and subleading dilepton pairs ( 4𝜇, 2𝑒2𝜇,2𝜇2𝑒,4𝑒). A neural-network-based classifier is employed to discriminate between the Higgs boson signal and the dominant 𝑍𝑍∗→4ℓbackground. The 𝑚𝐻measurement is performed with a simultaneous unbinnedmaximumlikelihoodfitofthereconstructedinvariantmassofthefourleptonssystem, 𝑚4ℓ,in 3 the four sub-channels. The 𝑚4ℓresolution ranges from about 1.5 GeV ( 4𝜇and2𝑒2𝜇sub-channels) to about 2.1 GeV ( 2𝜇2𝑒and4𝑒sub-channels). The signal model consists of a double-sided Crystal Ball probabilitydensityfunction,withthemeanofitsGaussiancoreparameterizedasafunctionof 𝑚𝐻and the standard deviation expressed as a function of the predicted event-level resolution. The signal and background normalization for each of the four sub-channels are free parameters in the fit. Compared with the measurement reported in Ref.

The dominant sources of systematic uncertainty on the measurement are the uncertainties in the muon momentum scale, resolution and sagitta biascorrection( 28MeV)andtheelectronenergyscale [26]( 19MeV).Acombinationwiththemeasurement of𝑚𝐻using the Run 1 dataset [14], 𝑚𝐻=124.51±0.52(stat.)±0.04(syst.)=124.51±0.52 GeVhas beenperformed.

The combined mass measurement in the 𝐻→𝛾𝛾channel [16] is similarly affected by the statistical uncertainty(110 MeV)andthesystematicuncertainty(90 MeV),mainlyassociatedtothephotonenergy scale calibration. In contrast, the combined mass measurement in the 𝐻→𝑍𝑍∗→4ℓchannel [17] is primarily dominated by the statistical uncertainty (170 MeV), while the systematic uncertainty, mainly related the muon momentum scale calibration, has a minor impact (30 MeV) on the measurement. The differences
2308.04775v2.pdf|||between the two channels can be traced to the distinct decay branching ratios, final state reconstruction efficiencies, background levels, and the resulting signal-to-background ratios in the two channels. A detailed comparison of the two channels, qualitatively similar to those presented here, is given in Ref. [28]. In the𝐻→𝛾𝛾and𝐻→𝑍𝑍∗→4ℓchannels combination, the correlations between systematic uncertaintiesinthetwomeasurementsareaccountedforintheprofilelikelihoodfunctionbyusingthesame constraint for each of the correlated NP. All potential correlations between measurements and data-taking periods are thoroughly examined.

InthecombinationsoftheRun1andRun2measurements ofthe𝐻→𝛾𝛾and𝐻→𝑍𝑍∗→4ℓindividualchannels,thecorrelationoftheexperimentalsystematic uncertainties follows what was done in Refs. [16] and [17], respectively. The correlation scheme between the Run 1𝐻→𝛾𝛾and𝐻→𝑍𝑍∗→4ℓmeasurements is unchanged relative to the published Run 1 combination [14].

After event categorisation, the signal yield is extracted by a simultaneous ﬁt to the 20 dimuon mass ( 𝑚𝜇𝜇) distributions in the range 110–160 GeVtogether with background normalisation and shape parameters, exploiting the resonant behaviour of the Higgs boson signal. The Higgs boson is assumed to have a mass of𝑚𝐻=12509GeV[5]forallresultspresented. MorerecentmeasurementsoftheHiggsbosonmass[16, 17] are compatible within their uncertainties with this value. 2 ATLAS detector The ATLAS detector [18, 19] covers nearly the entire solid angle around the collision point.1It consists of aninnertrackingdetectorsurroundedbyathinsuperconductingsolenoid,electromagneticandhadronic calorimeters, and a muon spectrometer incorporating three large superconducting toroid magnets. The inner detector (ID) system is immersed in a 2 T axial magnetic ﬁeld and provides charged-particle tracking in the range j𝜂j25. A high-granularity silicon pixel detector covers the vertex region and typically provides four measurements per track. It is surrounded by a silicon microstrip tracker, which typically provides four measurement points per track. These silicon detectors are complemented by a transition radiation tracker, which enables radially extended track reconstruction up to j𝜂j=20.

The trigger eﬃciency for the sum of the 𝐻!𝜇𝜇signal processes is about 91%relative to the common event preselection discussed in Section 4. Samples of simulated Monte Carlo (MC) events are used to optimise the selection, to model the signal processes and to develop an analytic function to model the 𝑚𝜇𝜇distributions for the background estimate. The signal samples as well as a complete set of background processes were processed through the full ATLASdetectorsimulation[21]basedon G/e.pc/a.pc/n.pc/t.pc 4[22],henceforthreferredtoasfullysimulatedsamples.

However,thestatisticaluncertaintiesinthedominantDYbackgroundarealimitingfactorin studying the background modelling at the level required by the small expected 𝐻!𝜇𝜇signal. Therefore, two fast-simulation set-ups were developed to generate signiﬁcantly larger DY samples.

In total, two sets of about 10–20billion events are prepared in this way, corresponding to an equivalent integrated luminosity of at least 50ab 1in the kinematic phase space relevant for the analysis.

Since muons may lose a signiﬁcant fraction of their energy by QED FSR, up to one ﬁnal-state photon candidate per event is included in the 𝑚𝜇𝜇calculation to improve the signal reconstruction.

Compared toeventsfromthe dominant DY background, signal events from both ggF and VBF production are characterised by larger 𝑝𝜇𝜇 Tand smaller absolute values of 𝑦𝜇𝜇. The cos𝜃distributions provide some discrimination due to diﬀerent spin-structures and 𝑍–𝛾interference eﬀects for the DY background [116]. For the leading and subleading jetsinthe event(denotedby 𝑗1and𝑗2),the followingvariablesare computed: 𝑝Tand𝜂of𝑗1and𝑗2;the azimuthal separation between the dimuon system and each jet, Δ𝜙𝜇𝜇𝑗 1andΔ𝜙𝜇𝜇𝑗 2; the kinematics of the dĳetsystem( 𝑗𝑗)characterisedbytransversemomentum 𝑝𝑗𝑗 T,mass𝑚𝑗𝑗andrapidity𝑦𝑗𝑗;andtheazimuthal separationbetweenthedimuonanddĳetsystems, Δ𝜙𝜇𝜇𝑗𝑗. Thesevariablesexploittheuniquesignature oftheVBFprocess: twohigh- 𝑝Tjetsseparatedbyalargerapiditygapwithlittlehadronicactivity. For jets that have a high 𝑝T¡50GeVand are in the central region j𝜂j21, the multiplicity of ID tracks with𝑝T¡05GeVassociatedwitheachofthetwoleadingjets, 𝑁𝑗𝑖 track,isalsousedtohelpdiscriminate betweenjetsproducedbyfragmentationofgluonsandquarks[117,118]. Inaddition, 𝐸miss Tand𝐻T,which can discriminate the 𝑡¯𝑡background from the signal, are also considered. From the𝑂VBFclassiﬁer, four categories in the region with the highest score are selected and named VBF Very High, High, Medium, and Low. The expected 𝐻!𝜇𝜇signal contributing to these categories is dominated by the VBF process with a purity ranging from about 93% (VBF Very High) to 65% (VBF Low) and the expected SM signal-to-background ratio computed in the 120–130GeVmass window varies between18%(VBFVeryHigh)and2.8%(VBFLow). ThepredictednumberofSMsignaleventsinthe VBF categories ranges between 2.8 and 7.5 events. The remaining events are considered for further classiﬁcation in three other BDTs split by jet multiplicity, withscoresdenotedas 𝑂¹0 2º ggF. TheseBDTsaretrainedwithboththe 𝐻!𝜇𝜇ggFandVBFproduction MC samples as signal. In each jet category, the same three
2007.07830v2.pdf|||variables characterising the dimuon system and discussed above are used, i.e. 𝑝𝜇𝜇 T,𝑦𝜇𝜇andcos𝜃. For the 1-jet BDT, they are complemented by the transverse momentum 𝑝𝑗1 T, pseudorapidity 𝜂𝑗1, the track multiplicity 𝑁𝑗1 trackin the jet, and the azimuthal separation from the dimuon system, Δ𝜙𝜇𝜇𝑗 1. In the 2-jet category the same variables as in the VBF BDT are used. The events in each of these three jet multiplicity categories are further classiﬁed into four categories on the basis of the𝑂¹0 2º ggFscores to yield a total of 12 mutually exclusive categories called 𝑁-jet Very High, High, MediumandLowwith 𝑁=012. TheggFproductionprocesscontributes 80%–100%oftheexpected 𝐻!𝜇𝜇signal in these categories. The expected SM signal-to-background ratio in the 120–130GeV 10 masswindowvariesfrom 17%–15%(2-jetVeryHighand1-jetVeryHigh)to 007%(0-jetLow). The predicted number of SM signal events in the ggF categories ranges between 17 and 125 events. 6 Signal and background modelling and systematic uncertainties The signal extraction is based on a binned maximum-likelihood ﬁt to the invariant mass spectrum of the dimuon system as described in Section 7. Analytic models are used in the ﬁt to describe the 𝑚𝜇𝜇 distributions for both the signal and background processes. 6.1 Signal modelling In the SM, the 𝐻!𝜇𝜇signal is predicted to be a narrow resonance with a width of 41MeVfor 𝑚𝐻=12509GeV. The observed signal shape is thus determined by detector resolution eﬀects on the muon momentummeasurement. Adouble-sided CrystalBall functionis used for the Higgssignal model. This function is a modiﬁcation of the Crystal Ball function [119, 120], and consists of a Gaussian central part with a power-law tail on each side. For each of the 20 categories, the signal parameters are ﬁtted to signal MC spectra summed over all productionmodes( ggF,VBF,𝑉𝐻,𝑡¯𝑡𝐻)assumingtherelativenormalisationsaspredictedbytheSM.Within eachcategorynosigniﬁcantdiﬀerencesarefoundbetweenthesignalshapesofthediﬀerentproduction modes, indicating that the signal parameterisation is not sensitive to the assumption on their relative normalisations. The width of the Gaussian component of the double-sided Crystal
2007.07830v2.pdf|||Ball function varies between 2.6 and 3.2 GeVdepending on the category. Potential biases in the extracted signal yields due to the analytic parameterisations are tested with a signal injection procedure: in a signal-plus-background ﬁt to pseudo-data constructed from the expected signal and background distributions, the extracted signal yields agree with those injected within the statistical accuracy of about 0.3%. Severalsourcesofsystematicuncertaintyinthesignalmodellingareconsidered,includingboththeoretical and experimental eﬀects. The theoretical uncertainties in the signal production aﬀect the number of signal eventsexpectedineachcategory. Theuncertaintiesconsideredforthemainproductionmodes( ggFand VBF)includetheimpactofthemissinghigher-orderQCDcorrections,PDFs,theunderlyingeventand hadronisation. In particular, the uncertainty in the ggF signal is derived using the approach described in Ref. [11], including eﬀects from the variation of QCD scales for factorisation, renormalisation and resummation,andthemigrationbetweenjet-multiplicityregions[121–128]. Theuncertaintyinthe ggF Higgs boson transverse momentum, including the eﬀect of migration between diﬀerent kinematic regions and of the treatment of the top-quark mass in the loop corrections, is also taken into account. In addition, dedicated uncertainties are assigned for the ggF signal acceptance in VBF topologies. The uncertainties in thepredictedSMbranchingratioandHiggsbosonproductioncrosssectionsareincludedinaccordwith Ref.[11]. Theuncertaintiesassociatedwiththemodellingoftheunderlyingeventandpartonshoweringare estimated by considering the P/y.pc/t.pc/h.pc/i.pc/a.pc8 systematic eigentune variations and by comparing events showered byP/y.pc/t.pc/h.pc/i.pc/a.pc8 with those showered by H/e.pc/r.pc/w.pc/i.pc/g.pc7 [129, 130]. The impact of the theory uncertainties on the predicted signal acceptances in the diﬀerent categories ranges between a few per mill and 15% for ggF production. Similarly,fortheVBFproductiontheimpactofthetheoryuncertaintiesonthepredictedsignal acceptancesvariesbetweenafewpermilland7%. Forthe 𝑉𝐻and𝑡¯𝑡𝐻categoriesthetheorysystematic 11 uncertainties have an impact on the predicted signal acceptances of between a few per mill and about 18%. Systematic uncertainties related to the diﬀerent reconstructed physics objects used in the analysis aﬀect the expected signal yields in each category. In addition, systematic uncertainties in the muon momentum scale and resolutionalso aﬀectthe signal massdistribution. Theexperimental uncertaintiesconsidered are the muon reconstruction and identiﬁcation eﬃciencies, the eﬃciencies due to the trigger, isolation and impact parameterrequirements,themuonmomentumscaleandresolution[100,131,132],thedeterminationofthe 𝐸miss Tsoftterm[110],the 𝑏-taggingeﬃciency[109],theuncertaintyinthenumberoftracksassociatedwith thejets[117],thepile-upmodelling[90],anduncertaintiesintheelectronreconstructionandidentiﬁcation eﬃciency [103] as well as in the jet reconstruction eﬃciency,

The𝑚𝜇𝜇background spectrum is parameterised by analytic functions that can describe this distribution at the per-mill level to avoid a signiﬁcant bias in the extracted signal yields.

A corefunctionthatdescribestheDYmassshapeinclusivelyismultiplied by anempirical function that can correct for distortions of the mass shape due to the event selection and categorisation, higher-order theory corrections and other smaller background contributions. The empirical functions chosen are also ﬂexible enough to describe the background shape in categories where the dominant background is not the DY process. The core function has no free parameters and is common to all categories, while the empirical functions have a certain number of free parameters that are selected and ﬁt to data independently in each category.

The SS yields are taken as the measured signals obtained in signal-plus-background ﬁts to the background-only MC templates. They are determined not only for a signal mass of 125GeV, but also forvaluesof 𝑚𝐻between120and130 GeVinstepsof 1GeV.

For the functions that satisfy these criteria, a spurious-signal test is performed separately in each category.

Ifmorethanonefunctionpercategorypassesthislastselection,theonewiththesmallestSSisselected. The maximum absolute value of the SS in the mass range 120–130 GeVis taken to be the background modelling uncertainty for the respective category. As an additional cross-check, the SS tests for the ggF and VBF-enriched categories are also performed on the fully simulated S/h.pc/e.pc/r.pc/p.pc/a.pcDY samples and the alternative fast DY simulation based on the merged P/o.pc/w.pc/h.pc/e.pc/g.pc-B/o.pc/x.pc andA/l.pc/p.pc/g.pc/e.pc/n.pcDY samples as explained in Section 3. Further cross-checks are performed with the fast DY simulation after applying several theoretical variations, such as changes of the QCD renormalisation and factorisation scales by factors of two and one half and alternative PDF sets, and experimental variations of the muon momentum resolution and

In all these checks, no statistically signiﬁcant increase in the SS values 13 is found, hence they are not included as additional systematic uncertainty since their impact would be negligible. The SS systematic uncertainty also addresses any potential local biases in the mass spectra closetothesignalregioncausedbytheexperimentalselections,suchastheBDTscorerequirementsorthe lepton pairing procedure in the 𝑉𝐻categories.

IftheSSuncertaintieswereconsideredasfullycorrelatedbetweencategories,theexpectedsigniﬁcance would change by less than 2%. The SS uncertainties in the diﬀerent categories range from a few per cent up to about 20% of the expected data statistical uncertainties in the VBF and ggF categories and up to about 30% in the 𝑉𝐻and𝑡¯𝑡𝐻 categories, which have less statistical precision in their background simulated samples. 6.3 Other systematic uncertainties Inadditiontothesystematicuncertaintiesinthesignalandbackgroundmodellingdescribedabove,the uncertainty of 17%in the combined 2015–2018 integrated luminosity is also considered. It is derived from the calibration of the luminosity scale using 𝑥–𝑦beam-separation scans [134], obtained using the LUCID-2 detector [135] for the primary luminosity measurements. 7 Results The signal yield is obtained by a simultaneous binned maximum-likelihood ﬁt to the 𝑚𝜇𝜇distributions of the 20 categories in the range 110–160 GeV. The chosen bin size is 0.1 GeV. Conﬁdence intervals are based on the proﬁle-likelihood-ratio test statistic [136]. The systematic uncertainties listed in Section 6 are implemented in the ﬁt as nuisance parameters constrained by additional Gaussian or log-normal likelihood terms and the Higgs boson is assumed to have a mass of 𝑚𝐻=¹12509024ºGeV.

The observed properties of the particle, such as its couplings to Standard Model (SM) elementary particles, its spin and its parity, are so far consistent with the predictions for the SM Higgs boson [3–7]. MeasurementsofraredecaysoftheHiggsboson,suchas 𝐻!ℓℓ𝛾whereℓisanelectronormuon,can probecouplingmodiﬁcationsintroducedbypossibleextensionstotheSM[8]. Inaddition,suchthree-body Higgs boson decays can be used to probe 𝐶𝑃-violation in the Higgs sector [9, 10]. Multipleprocessescontributetothe 𝐻!ℓℓ𝛾decay: Dalitzdecaysinvolvinga 𝑍bosonoravirtualphoton (𝛾) (Figure 1(a–c)), as well as the decay of the Higgs boson to two leptons and a photon from ﬁnal-state radiation (FSR) (Figure 1(d)). Their respective fractions depend on the invariant mass of the dilepton pair, 𝑚ℓℓ. In this analysis only low-mass dilepton pairs with 𝑚ℓℓ30GeVare considered. This region is completelydominatedbythedecaythrough 𝛾[8,11,12]. Thecontributionsoftheotherprocessesand interferences are negligible.

In addition, both the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations carried out searches atp𝑠=13TeVfor the closely related 𝐻!𝑍𝛾 process[13, 14]. The CMSCollaborationalso searchedfor thelow- 𝑚ℓℓ𝐻!ℓℓ𝛾processin thedimuon and dielectron channels in 𝑝𝑝collisions atp𝑠=8TeV [15]. Thispaperdescribesasearchfor 𝐻!𝑒𝑒𝛾and𝐻!𝜇𝜇𝛾decayswith𝑚ℓℓ30GeV. Whentheinvariant mass of the two electrons is low and the transverse momentum of the dielectron system is high, their electromagnetic showers can overlap in the calorimeter. Therefore, the search for 𝑒𝑒𝛾ﬁnal states requires the development of dedicated electron trigger and identiﬁcation algorithms. The search uses 𝑝𝑝collision data atp𝑠=13TeVrecorded with the ATLAS detector during Run 2 of the LHCbetween2015and2018,correspondingtoatotalintegratedluminosityof139 fb 1. Thesensitivityof the search is enhanced by dividing the selected events into mutually exclusive categories, according to the event topology and lepton ﬂavour. The dominant background is the irreducible non-resonant production of ℓℓ𝛾. After event categorisation, the signal yield is extracted by a simultaneous ﬁt of parametric functions to the reconstructed ℓℓ𝛾invariant mass ( 𝑚ℓℓ𝛾) distributions in all categories. 2 2 ATLAS detector The ATLAS detector [16] covers nearly the entire solid angle around the collision point.1It consists of an inner tracking detector (ID) surrounded by a thin superconducting solenoid providing a 2Taxial magneticﬁeld,electromagnetic(EM)andhadroncalorimeters,andamuonspectrometer(MS).TheID covers the pseudorapidity range j𝜂j25.

The longitudinal segmentation of the EM calorimeter is also exploited to calibrate the energy response of electron and photon candidates [19]. The MS comprises separate trigger and high-precision tracking chambersmeasuringthedeﬂectionofmuonsinamagneticﬁeldgeneratedbysuperconductingair-core toroids.

Themuontriggersystemcoverstherange j𝜂j24withresistive-platechambersinthebarrel,andthin-gap chambers in the endcap regions. A two-level trigger system [20] was used during thep𝑠=13TeVdata-taking period. The ﬁrst-level trigger (L1) is implemented in hardware and uses a subset of the detector information. This is followed by a software-based high-level trigger which runs algorithms similar to those in the oﬄine reconstruction software, reducing the event rate to approximately 1 kHz from the maximum L1 rate of 100 kHz. 3 Data and simulated event samples Theanalysed 𝑝𝑝collisiondata correspondtothe fullrecorded LHCRun-2 datasetatp𝑠=13TeVwith an integrated luminosity of 139 fb 1after data quality requirements [21]. The events were collected with a combination of single-lepton, dilepton, diphoton, and lepton+photon triggers. Standard electron triggers, which require narrow, isolated EM energy clusters, are eﬃcient if the two electrons in the event have a very small angular separation Δ𝑅𝑒𝑒, as the two electrons produce a cluster that is similar to that of a single electron. For Δ𝑅𝑒𝑒¡01, two separate EM clusters are typically produced. For the 2017 and 2018 data-taking periods, a dedicated trigger was introduced which requires at least one photon with 𝑝T¡35GeVand at least one EM cluster with 𝑝T¡25GeVmatched to at least one ID track. The EM cluster must have low hadronic leakage, but no requirement is imposed on the width of the shower, which allows this new trigger to recover a signiﬁcant fraction of the signal with 0025Δ𝑅𝑒𝑒01.

Theoveralltriggereﬃcienciesforthe 𝐻!𝑒𝑒𝛾and𝐻!𝜇𝜇𝛾processes are98%and96%, respectively ( 97%combined), relative to the event selection discussed in Section 5. The uncertainty in the trigger eﬃciency is negligible. Samples of simulated Monte Carlo (MC) events are crucial for the optimisation of the search strategy and the modelling of the signal and background processes. Simulated 𝐻!𝛾𝛾!ℓℓ𝛾signal and 𝐻!𝛾𝛾background events are used to parameterise these processes, and simulated non-Higgs ℓℓ𝛾events are used to choose analytic functional forms to describe the non-resonant background. The generated MCevents,unlessstatedotherwise,wereprocessedwiththefullATLASdetectorsimulation[23]based onG/e.pc/a.pc/n.pc/t.pc 4[24]. The eﬀect of multiple 𝑝𝑝interactions in the same and neighbouring bunch crossings (pile-up)wasincludedbyoverlayingminimum-biaseventssimulatedwith P/y.pc/t.pc/h.pc/i.pc/a.pc8.186[25]usingthe NNPDF2.3LOpartondistributionfunction(PDF)set[26]andtheA3set[27]oftunedparameters. The MCeventswere weightedtoreproduce thedistributionof thenumberof interactionsperbunch crossing observed in the data. Higgsbosonproductioninthegluon–gluonfusion( ggF)andvector-bosonfusion( VBF)productionmodes, as well as in quark-initiated associated production with a 𝑊or𝑍boson (𝑞¯𝑞𝑞𝑔!VH) or with two top quarks (𝑡¯𝑡𝐻) was modelled with the P/o.pc/w.pc/h.pc/e.pc/g.pc-B/o.pc/x.pc v2 MC event generator [28–32]. P/o.pc/w.pc/h.pc/e.pc/g.pc-B/o.pc/x.pc v2 was interfaced with P/y.pc/t.pc/h.pc/i.pc/a.pc8 [25] to simulate the 𝐻!𝛾𝛾!ℓℓ𝛾and𝐻!𝛾𝛾decays. P/y.pc/t.pc/h.pc/i.pc/a.pcalso provides parton showering, hadronisation and the underlying event. The PDF4LHC15 PDF set [33] was used, except for 𝑡¯𝑡𝐻, where the NNPDF3.0nlo PDF set [26] was used. For the ggFprocess, the P/o.pc/w.pc/h.pc/e.pc/g.pcNNLOPS program [34, 35] achieves next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) accuracy in QCD for inclusive observables after reweighting the Higgs boson rapidity spectrum [36]. The simulation reaches next-to-leading-order (NLO) accuracy in QCD for the VBF,VH, and𝑡¯𝑡𝐻processes. For VH, the MiNLO technique [37–39] was

No simulated samples are available for gluon-initiated associated productionwitha 𝑍boson(𝑔𝑔!ZH)andassociatedproductionwithtwo 𝑏-quarks(bbH).Theirminor contribution, 1% of the expected Higgs boson production, is modelled using the acceptances from the 𝑞¯𝑞𝑞𝑔!ZHandggFsamples, respectively.

Weightswerecalculatedbycomparingthegenerator-level Higgsbosontransversemomentumandjetdistributionsinthesesampleswiththedistributionsobtained from the nominal 𝐻!𝛾𝛾samples. The weights are applied to the 𝐻!𝛾𝛾!ℓℓ𝛾ggFandVBF samples to estimate the eﬀect of varying the parton shower and underlying event. ThemassoftheHiggsbosonwassetinthesimulationto 𝑚𝐻=125GeVanditswidthto Γ𝐻=41MeV[41]. The Higgs mass peak position in the simulation was corrected to account for the small diﬀerence relative to the measured value of 125.09 GeV[42] (see Section 6); otherwise the eﬀect on the kinematics is neglected. Thesignaland 𝐻!𝛾𝛾sampleswerenormalisedwiththebestavailabletheoreticalcalculationsofthe corresponding SM production cross-sections at 𝑚𝐻=12509GeV, which are available at next-to-next-to- next-to-leadingorder(N3LO)inQCDwithNLOelectroweak(EW)correctionsfor ggF[41,43–54],at approximate-NNLOinQCDwithNLOEWcorrectionsfor VBF[41,55–57],atNNLOinQCDwithNLO EW corrections for 𝑞¯𝑞𝑞𝑔!VH[41, 58–65] and at NLO in QCD with NLO electroweak corrections for 𝑡¯𝑡𝐻[41,66–69]. TheaccuracyofthecalculationisNNLOinQCDfor bbH[70–72],andNLOinQCD with next-to-leading-logarithm (NLL) corrections for 𝑔𝑔!ZH[41, 61]. There are multiple calculations of the 𝐻!ℓℓ𝛾branching ratios for diﬀerent slices of phase space [8, 11, 12, 73–76]. The 𝐻!ℓℓ𝛾branching ratios used in this analysis are B¹𝐻!𝑒𝑒𝛾º=72010 5and 4 B¹𝐻!𝜇𝜇𝛾º=34210 5, as estimated with P/y.pc/t.pc/h.pc/i.pc/a.pc8 for𝑚ℓℓ30GeV. Their sum corresponds to5% of the𝐻!𝛾𝛾branching ratio. When extrapolated to a common phase space, the P/y.pc/t.pc/h.pc/i.pc/a.pc8 estimate agrees with the predictions of Refs. [74, 76] within a relative diﬀerence of 3%. Currently, no theoretical uncertainty calculation exists for the low- 𝑚ℓℓ𝐻!ℓℓ𝛾branching ratio. Therefore, the theoretical uncertainties in the 𝐻!𝛾𝛾and𝐻!𝑍𝛾branching ratios are considered [12], and the larger of the two uncertainties is used, which corresponds to the 5.8% relative uncertainty in the 𝐻!𝑍𝛾 branching ratio [41]. The background originates mainly from non-resonant ℓℓ𝛾production. Events were simulated with theS/h.pc/e.pc/r.pc/p.pc/a.pc2.2.8 [77] generator based on LO matrix elements for ℓℓ𝛾production with up to three additional partons and using the NNPDF3.0 PDF set [78].

A subset of the muon candidates are also required to be isolated from additional activity in the tracking detector and in the calorimeters, using a loose isolation selection [79, 80].

The performance of the electron and photon reconstruction, including the associated systematic uncertainties, is studied in Ref. [19]. 5 Photon candidates can be either unconverted or converted. In the latter case, a track or conversion vertex is matched to the EM cluster.

Tosuppressbackgroundsfromconverted photons, tracks must also have a hit in the innermost pixel layer, and merged-electron candidates are rejected if they match a conversion vertex with a radius larger than 20 mm whose momentum agrees better withthe cluster energythan the momentumof the trackthat geometrically matchesthe clusterbest.

The quantity j𝜂ℓℓ𝛾 05¹𝜂𝑗1¸𝜂𝑗2ºj[88] is required to be less than 2.0, where 𝜂ℓℓ𝛾isthepseudorapidityofthe ℓℓ𝛾systemand𝜂𝑗1(𝜂𝑗2)isthepseudorapidityoftheleading(subleading) jet.

These jet variables are expected to have a diﬀerent shape for the VBF signal and the background from QCD processes. The𝑝T𝑡is deﬁned as the component of the transverse momentum of the ℓℓ𝛾system that is perpendicular to thediﬀerence of the three-momentaof the dileptonsystem and the photoncandidate ( 𝑝T𝑡=j®𝑝ℓℓ𝛾 Tˆ𝑡j, where ˆ𝑡=¹®𝑝ℓℓ T ®𝑝𝛾 Tºj®𝑝ℓℓ T ®𝑝𝛾 Tj).

The table also summarises the observed number of events in data in the 𝑚ℓℓ𝛾mass range of 110–160 GeV. 6 Signal and background modelling To extract the observed signal yield, parametric functions are chosen to model the ℓℓ𝛾invariant mass distributionsofsignalandbackgroundineachanalysiscategory. Acombinedmodelisbuiltfromthese functionsandﬁttotheselecteddatainthe 𝑚ℓℓ𝛾rangeof110 160GeV,simultaneouslyinallcategories. The signal model, including its parameters, is obtained by ﬁtting a double-sided Crystal Ball function (DSCB) [91, 92] to the 𝑚ℓℓ𝛾distribution obtained from the 𝐻!𝛾𝛾!ℓℓ𝛾samples described in Section3afterapplyingtheeventselectionandcategorisationfromSection5. TheDSCBfunctionfeatures a Gaussian core and asymmetric power-law tails. A shift of +0.09 GeVis applied to the mean of the GaussianfunctiontoaccountforthefactthatthesampleassumesaHiggsbosonmassof125 GeV. The eﬀective signal mass resolution, deﬁned as half the width containing 68% of the signal events, depends on the category and lies between 1.6 GeV(𝑒𝑒-merged high- 𝑝T𝑡category) and 2.2 GeV(𝑒𝑒-resolved low- 𝑝T𝑡 category).

Toestimatethefractionofevents with a misidentiﬁed photon, a control region is formed using the signal selection, but dropping the photon isolationrequirementandusingitasadiscriminatingvariableinatemplateﬁt. Abackgroundtemplate enriched in events with misidentiﬁed photons is built by inverting the photon identiﬁcation selection, withtheprompt-photoncontaminationremovedbysubtractingitsdistributionfoundinsimulatedevents. The template normalisation is obtained in the background-dominated sideband of the photon isolation distribution for each category separately. In the signal region, about 10% of all selected events have a misidentiﬁedphoton,independentlyofthecategory. Thefractionofeventswithamisidentiﬁedelectron or muon that is in fact a hadronic jet, a lepton from heavy-ﬂavour decays or an electron from a photon conversion, is estimated in a similar manner, using a control region in which the isolation selection is dropped for the softer lepton. The estimated fractions of events with misidentiﬁed leptons are 4% in the𝜇𝜇low-𝑝T𝑡category, 2% in the 𝑒𝑒-merged low- 𝑝T𝑡category, and 30% in the 𝑒𝑒-resolved low- 𝑝T𝑡 category. Events in the last category are separated into two groups depending on the angular distance between the electrons, as two populations with diﬀerent misidentiﬁed-electron rates and mass distributions werefound. Thenumbersintheothercategoriesareextractedaswell,butsuﬀerfromfairlylargestatistical uncertainties. The invariant mass template for the non-resonant ℓℓ𝛾background is built from the simulated events describedinSection3.

Reasonable agreement isobservedbetweenthetemplatescontainingthesumofallbackgroundsandthesidebandsofthe 𝑚ℓℓ𝛾 distributions in data (105  120 GeV and 130 160 GeV). The choice of ﬁt function for the non-resonant background is made in each category using signal-plus- backgroundﬁtstotheconstructedbackground-onlytemplatebymeasuringthebiasassociatedwitheach function, expressed as the number of ﬁtted signal events, and choosing the function with the smallest number of degrees of freedom that satisﬁes the bias criteria described below. The functional forms used to model the background are selected from the following: exponential ( e𝛼𝑚ℓℓ𝛾), exponential of a second-order polynomial ( e𝛼𝑚ℓℓ𝛾¸𝛽𝑚2 ℓℓ𝛾), and a power-law function ( 𝑚𝛼 ℓℓ𝛾), where𝛼 and𝛽are free parameters. Signal hypotheses with 𝑚𝐻ranging from 121 GeVto 129GeVare
2103.10322v2.pdf|||tested in steps of 1 GeV, and the ﬁt bias is evaluated as the absolute maximum bias over this range (referred to as the ‘spurious signal’ in the following), similar to what is done in Ref. [1]. A function passes the test if the spurious signal is less than 10% of the expected number of 𝐻!𝛾𝛾!ℓℓ𝛾events or less than 20%ofthestatisticaluncertaintyoftheﬁttedspurioussignalduetotheexpectednumberofbackground events. Toaccountforstatisticalﬂuctuationsinthebackgroundtemplate,thecriteriaarerelaxedbythe statistical uncertainty due to the template [93]. Furthermore, in a background-only ﬁt of the template in the mass range 110 𝑚ℓℓ𝛾160GeV, the function must pass a 𝜒2test with a probability larger than1%. AsdescribedinRef.[93],anadditionalcheckisperformedbyﬁttingboththechosenfunction and a function belonging to the same family with one more degree of freedom to the sidebands of the 𝑚ℓℓ𝛾distribution in data, to ensure the data do not prefer the more complex function. Following the procedure described above, the power-law function is selected for all categories, except for the 𝜇𝜇low-𝑝T𝑡 10 and𝑒𝑒-merged low- 𝑝T𝑡categories, which are best described by the second-order exponential polynomial, and the𝑒𝑒-resolved VBF- enrichedcategory, for which the exponential function is chosen. Anunbinnedextendedlikelihoodfunctionisformedfromtheproductofeachcategory’sparameterised signal-plus-background probabilitydensity function. Systematic uncertaintiesare considered in theform of nuisance parameters with Gaussian or log-normal constraints. They are correlated across all categories, except for the spurious-signal uncertainties. The latter are implemented for each category as a signal-like component with a yield parameter that is constrained by a Gaussian function, centred at zero, with a width corresponding to the estimated spurious signal. The Higgs boson mass is set to 125.09 0.24GeV[42]. The parameter of interest is the signal strength 𝜇, which is deﬁned as the ratio of the measured signal yield to the SM expectation, taking into account the uncertainties on the latter. The corresponding proﬁle likelihood ratio is maximised to extract the best-ﬁt 𝜇[94]. A possible excess over the background-only hypothesis is quantiﬁed by a 𝑝-value using the proﬁle likelihood

In this case, the included theory uncertainties are adjusted as discussed in Section 7, and the acceptance is extracted with the simulated samples described in Section 3. 7 Systematic uncertainties The total observed systematic uncertainty in the signal strength measurement is 11%, which is about 35% of the size of the statistical uncertainty. Therefore, systematic uncertainties do not play a dominant role in this analysis. Thedominantexperimentalsystematicuncertaintiesareduetotheestimatedbiasesintheﬁttedsignalevents (spurious signal, see Section 6). The corresponding uncertainty in the observed signal strength amounts to 6.1%. Other non-negligible systematic uncertainties relate to photon and lepton identiﬁcation eﬃciencies in the simulated signal samples, in particular for merged- 𝑒𝑒objects, as well as the energy/momentum calibration (see Section 4). Including jet uncertainties, which have a much smaller impact, these add up to 4.0%. The uncertainty in the combined 2015–2018 integrated luminosity is 1.7% [95], obtained using the LUCID-2 detector [96] for the primary luminosity measurements. Uncertainties in the pile-up modelling contribute1.7%. Uncertaintiesintheestimateofthe 𝐻!𝛾𝛾backgroundhaveasmallimpactof0.7%.

The analysis is performed using a data set recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC with proton–proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 139 fb 1. For a Higgs boson with a mass of 125.09 GeVand𝑚ℓℓ30GeV, evidence for the 𝐻!ℓℓ𝛾 processisfoundwithasigniﬁcanceof3.2 𝜎overthebackground-onlyhypothesis,comparedtoanexpected signiﬁcance of 2.1 𝜎. The best-ﬁt value of the signal-strength parameter, deﬁned as the ratio of the observed signal yield to the signal yield expected in the Standard Model, is 𝜇=1505. The Higgs boson production cross-section times the 𝐻!ℓℓ𝛾branching ratio for 𝑚ℓℓ30GeVis determined to be 87¸28  27fb. This result constitutes the ﬁrst evidence for the decay of the Higgs boson into a pair of leptons and a photon, an important step towards probing Higgs boson couplings in this rare decay channel.

This result combines searches in four exclusive categories targeting the production of the Higgs boson via gluon fusion, via vector boson fusion, in association with a vector boson, and in as- sociation with a top quark-antiquark pair. The analysis is performed using proton- proton collision data atps=13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 137 fb 1, recorded by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC. An excess of events over the background expectation is observed in data with a signiﬁcance of 3.0 stan- dard deviations, where the expectation for the standard model (SM) Higgs boson with mass of 125.38 GeV is 2.5. The combination of this result with that from data recorded atps=7 and 8 TeV, corresponding to integrated luminosities of 5.1 and 19.7 fb 1, respectively, increases both the expected and observed signiﬁcances by 1%. The mea- sured signal strength, relative to the SM prediction, is 1.19+0.40  0.39(stat)+0.15  0.14(syst). This result constitutes the ﬁrst evidence for the decay of the Higgs boson to second gener- ation fermions and is the most precise measurement of the Higgs boson coupling to muons reported to date. ”Published in the Journal of High Energy Physics as doi:10.1007/JHEP01(2021)148 .” © 2021 CERN for the beneﬁt of the CMS Collaboration.

The interactions of the Higgs boson with the electroweak gauge bosons and charged fermions belonging
2009.04363v2.pdf|||to the third generation of the SM have been observed, with coupling strengths consistent with the SM predictions [4–17]. The Yukawa couplings of the Higgs boson to fermions of the ﬁrst and second generation, however, have yet to be established experimentally. The SM predicts that the strengths of the couplings of the Higgs boson to fermions are proportional to the fermion masses [18–21]. Consequently, the branching fractions of the Higgs boson to fermions of the ﬁrst and second generation are expected to be small, and their measurement at hadron colliders is challenging. The expected branching fraction for the decay of the Higgs boson with mass of 125 GeV to a pair of muons is B(H!m+m ) =2.1810 4[22]. The study of H !m+m  decays is of particular importance since it is the most experimentally sensitive probe of the Higgs boson couplings to second-generation fermions at the LHC. The CMS Collaboration performed a search for H !m+m decays using a combination of proton-proton (pp) collision data collected at centre-of-mass energies of 7, 8, and 13 TeV, cor- responding to integrated luminosities of 5.0, 19.7, and 35.9 fb 1, respectively. An observed (expected in absence of H !m+m decays) upper limit of 2.9 (2.2) times the SM prediction was set at the 95% conﬁdence level (CL) on the product of the Higgs boson production cross section andB(H!m+m )[23]. The corresponding signal strength, relative to the SM expectation, was m=1.01.0. The ATLAS Collaboration has performed a search for H !m+m decays using 13 TeV pp collision data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 139 fb 1, resulting in an observed (expected for m=0) upper limit at 95% CL of 2.2 (1.1) times the SM prediction and a signal strength m=1.20.6 [24]. This paper reports the ﬁrst evidence for H !m+m decays, obtained using pp collision data collected by the CMS experiment atps=13
2009.04363v2.pdf|||TeV and corresponding to a total integrated luminosity of 137 fb 1. The ﬁnal states considered contain two prompt, isolated, and oppo- sitely charged muons from the Higgs boson decay, with a narrow resonant invariant mass peak around the Higgs boson mass for signal events. The dimuon mass serves as a powerful discriminant against SM background processes. Events are separated into mutually exclusive categories targeting the main production modes of the Higgs boson at hadron colliders, namely gluon fusion (ggH), vector boson fusion (VBF), associated production with a vector boson (VH, where V =W or Z), and associated production with a top quark-antiquark pair (t tH). Results are given for mH=125.380.14 GeV, corresponding to the most precise measurement of the Higgs boson mass to date [25]. The ggH and VBF Higgs boson production modes have the largest cross sections at the LHC, and the event categories targeting these production modes are the most sensitive in this mea- surement. In the ggH category, the ﬁnal state may contain additional hadronic jets produced by initial-state (ISR) or ﬁnal-state (FSR) radiation. The largest background in this category con- sists of Drell–Yan (DY) events in which an off-shell Z boson decays to a pair of muons. Smaller background contaminations arise from t t and diboson (WW, WZ, ZZ) processes. In the VBF analysis, the ﬁnal state contains two jets with a large pseudorapidity separation ( Dhjj) and large dijet invariant mass ( mjj). These characteristic features allow a signiﬁcant suppression of the DY background, providing an expected sensitivity to H !m+m decays that is better than that of the ggH category, despite the smaller VBF production cross section. The VH signal events tar- geted by this analysis contain leptonic decays of the W or Z boson. This results in a ﬁnal state with three or more
2009.04363v2.pdf|||charged leptons, with the dominant background from WZ and ZZ events. 2 Finally, the t tH category contains the decays of a top quark-antiquark pair. Events in this cate- gory are therefore characterized by the presence of one or more b quark jets, and may contain additional charged leptons. The dominant backgrounds in the t tH category are the t t and t tZ processes. This paper is organized as follows: after a brief description of the CMS detector in Section 2, the event reconstruction, simulation, and selection are discussed in Sections 3, 4, and 5, re- spectively. Sections 6, 7, 8, and 9 are dedicated to the description of the four exclusive event categories designed to target the VBF, ggH, t tH, and VH production modes, respectively. Fi- nally, Section 10 describes the main results and their combination which are then summarized in Section 11. 2 The CMS detector The central feature of the CMS apparatus is a superconducting solenoid of 6 m internal diame- ter, providing a magnetic ﬁeld of 3.8 T. Within the solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scintilla- tor hadron calorimeter (HCAL), each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections. Forward calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. Muons are detected in gas-ionization chambers embedded in the steel ﬂux-return yoke out- side the solenoid. Events of interest are selected using a two-tiered trigger system [26]. The ﬁrst level (L1) is composed of custom hardware processors, which use information from the calorimeters and muon detectors to select events at a rate of about 100 kHz. The second level, known as high-level trigger (HLT), is a software-based system which runs a version of the CMS full event

A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a deﬁnition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in Ref. [27]. 3 Event reconstruction The particle-ﬂow (PF) algorithm [28] aims to reconstruct and identify each individual particle (PF candidate) in an event, with an optimized combination of information from the various el- ements of the CMS detector. The energy of photons is obtained from the ECAL measurement. The energy of electrons is determined from a combination of the electron momentum at the primary interaction vertex as determined by the silicon tracker, the energy of the correspond- ing ECAL cluster, and the energy sum of all bremsstrahlung photons spatially compatible with originating from the electron track. The energy of charged hadrons is determined from a combi- nation of their momentum measured in the silicon tracker and the matching ECAL and HCAL energy deposits, corrected for the response function of the calorimeters to hadronic showers. The energy of neutral hadrons is obtained from the corresponding corrected ECAL and HCAL energies. Finally, the momentum of muons is obtained from the curvature of the corresponding track reconstructed in the silicon tracker as well as in the muon system. For each event, hadronic jets are clustered from these reconstructed particles using the infrared and collinear-safe anti- kTalgorithm [29, 30] with a distance parameter of R=0.4. The jet mo- mentum is determined from the vectorial sum of the momenta of all particles in the jet, and is found from simulation to be, on average, within 5 to 10% of the true transverse momentum over the whole pTspectrum and detector acceptance. Additional pp interactions within the same or nearby bunch crossings (pileup) can contribute additional tracks and
2009.04363v2.pdf|||calorimetric en- ergy depositions to the jet momentum. To mitigate this effect, charged particles identiﬁed as 3 originating from pileup vertices are discarded and an offset correction is applied to subtract the remaining contributions from neutral particles [31]. Jet energy corrections are derived from simulation to bring, on average, the measured response of jets to that of particle-level jets. In situ measurements of the momentum balance in dijet, g+jets, Z+jets, and multijet events are used to account for any residual differences in jet energy scale between data and simulation. The jet energy resolution amounts typically to 15–20% at 30 GeV, 10% at 100 GeV, and 5% at 1 TeV [31]. Additional selection criteria are applied to each jet to remove those potentially dom- inated by anomalous contributions from various subdetector components or reconstruction failures [32]. The missing transverse momentum vector ~pmiss Tis computed as the negative vector pTsum of all the PF candidates in an event, and its magnitude is denoted as pmiss T[33]. The ~pmiss T is modiﬁed to account for corrections to the energy scale of the reconstructed jets in the event. Events with anomalously high- pmiss Tcan arise from a variety of reconstruction failures, detector malfunctions, or noncollision backgrounds. Such events are rejected by event ﬁlters that are designed to identify more than 85–90% of the spurious high- pmiss Tevents with a mistagging rate smaller than 0.1% [33]. Primary vertices are reconstructed from charged-particle tracks in the event. The candidate vertex with the largest value of the sum of the p2 Tof all associated physics objects is taken to be the primary pp interaction vertex. In this sum, the physics objects are the jets, clustered using the jet ﬁnding algorithm [29, 30] with the tracks assigned to candidate vertices as inputs, and the associated pmiss T, taken
2009.04363v2.pdf|||as the negative vector pTsum of those jets. Jets originating from the hadronization of b quarks are identiﬁed using a deep neural network (DeepCSV) that takes as input tracks displaced from the primary interaction vertex, identiﬁed secondary vertices, jet kinematic variables, and information related to the presence of soft lep- tons in the jet [34]. Working points (WPs) that yield either a 1% (medium WP) or a 10% (loose WP) probability of misidentifying a light-ﬂavour (udsg) jet with pT>30 GeV as a b quark jet are used. The corresponding average efﬁciencies for the identiﬁcation of the hadronization products of a bottom quark as a b quark jet are about 70 and 85%, respectively. Muon candidates, within the geometrical acceptance of the muon detectors ( jhj<2.4), are re- constructed by combining the information from the silicon tracker and the muon chambers [35]. These candidates are required to satisfy a set of quality criteria based on the number of hits mea- sured in the silicon tracker and in the muon system, the properties of the ﬁtted muon track, and the impact parameters of the track with respect to the primary vertex of the event. Electron can- didates withinjhj<2.5 are reconstructed using an algorithm that associates ﬁtted tracks in the silicon tracker with electromagnetic energy clusters in the ECAL [36]. To reduce the misidenti- ﬁcation rate, these candidates are required to satisfy identiﬁcation criteria based on the shower shape of the energy deposit, the matching of the electron track to the ECAL energy cluster, the relative amount of energy deposited in the HCAL detector, and the consistency of the electron track with the primary vertex. Because of nonoptimal reconstruction performance, electron candidates in the transition region between the ECAL barrel and endcaps, 1.44 <jhj<1.57, are discarded. Electron candidates identiﬁed as coming from photon
2009.04363v2.pdf|||conversions in the detec- tor are also rejected. Identiﬁed muons and electrons are required to be isolated from hadronic activity in the event. The isolation sum is deﬁned by summing the pTof all the PF candidates in a cone of radius R=p (Dh)2+ (Df)2=0.4(0.3)around the muon (electron) track, where f is the azimuthal angle in radians, and is corrected for the contribution of neutral particles from pileup interactions [35, 36]. 4 4 Event simulation Simulated events from Monte Carlo (MC) event generators for the signal and dominant back- ground processes are used to optimize the analysis strategy, evaluate the acceptance, and assess systematic uncertainties. The generated events are processed through a detailed simulation of the CMS detector based on G EANT 4 [37] and are reconstructed with the same algorithms that are used for data. The effect of pileup interactions is modelled by overlaying simulated in- elastic pp collisions on the hard-scattering event. The MC simulated events are weighted to reproduce the distribution of the number of interactions per bunch crossing observed in data. The ggH signal process is simulated at next-to-leading order (NLO) accuracy in perturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD), using both the M ADGRAPH 5aMC@NLO v2.4.2 [38] and POWHEG v2.0 [39–42] MC event generators. In the M ADGRAPH 5aMC@NLO event generation, up to two additional partons in the ﬁnal state are included in the matrix element (ME) calcu- lation. The pTdistribution of the Higgs boson produced via gluon fusion is then reweighted to match the POWHEG NNLOPS predictions [43, 44]. The VBF, qq !VH, and t tH processes are simulated with POWHEG v2.0 [45–47] at NLO precision in QCD. In addition to the four main production modes, the contributions due to Higgs boson production in association with a pair of b quarks (b bH), with a Z boson through
2009.04363v2.pdf|||gluon fusion (gg !ZH), and with a single top quark and either a W boson (tHW) or a quark (tHq) are also considered. The b bH process is simulated at NLO precision in QCD with POWHEG , while tHq and tHW (gg !ZH) events are generated at leading order (LO) with the M ADGRAPH 5aMC@NLO (POWHEG ) generator. Simulated signal events are generated, for each production mode, at mHvalues of 120, 125, and 130 GeV in order to interpolate signal models for every mHhypothesis in the 125 5 GeV range, following the procedure detailed in Section 10. Expected signal yields are normalized to the production cross sections and B(H!m+m ) values taken from the recommendations of Ref. [22]. The ggH production cross section is computed at next-to-next-to-NLO (N3LO) precision in QCD, and at NLO in electroweak (EW) theory [48]. The cross section of Higgs boson production in the VBF [49] and qq !VH [50] modes is calculated at next-to-NLO (NNLO) in QCD, including NLO EW corrections, while the t tH cross section is computed at NLO in QCD and EW theory [51, 52]. The b bH, tHq, and tHW cross sections are computed at NLO in QCD without including higher-order EW correc- tions [22, 53, 54]. The H !m+m partial width is computed with HDECAY [55, 56] at NLO in QCD and EW theory. The DY process, which is the main background in the ggH and VBF categories, is simulated at NLO in QCD using the M ADGRAPH 5aMC@NLO generator with up to two partons in the ﬁnal state at the ME level. The corresponding cross section is calculated with FEWZ v3.1b2 [57] at NNLO in QCD and NLO accuracy in EW theory. The EW production of a Z boson in association with two jets (Zjj-EW) is an important background in the
2009.04363v2.pdf|||VBF category. This process is simu- lated at LO using the M ADGRAPH 5aMC@NLO v2.6.5 generator. The WZ, q q!ZZ, and WW processes, which constitute the main backgrounds in the VH category, are simulated at NLO in QCD using either the POWHEG or M ADGRAPH 5aMC@NLO generators. Their production cross sections are corrected with the NNLO/NLO Kfactors taken from Refs. [58], [59], and [60]. The gluon-initiated loop-induced ZZ process (gg !ZZ) is simulated with the MCFM v7.0 gener- ator [61] at LO and the corresponding production cross section is corrected to match higher- order QCD predictions, following the strategy detailed in Ref. [9]. Minor contributions from triboson processes (WWW, WWZ, WZZ, and ZZZ) are also taken into account and are simu- lated at NLO in QCD using the M ADGRAPH 5aMC@NLO generator. The main backgrounds in the t tH category involve the production of top quarks. The t t background is simulated with 5 NLO precision in QCD using the POWHEG generator, and its cross section is obtained from the TOP++ v2.0 [62] prediction that includes NNLO corrections in QCD and resummation of NNLL soft gluon terms. The single top quark processes are simulated at NLO in QCD via ei- ther POWHEG or M ADGRAPH 5aMC@NLO and their cross sections are computed, at the same order of precision, using HATHOR [63]. Finally, contributions from the t tZ, t tW, t tWW, t ttt, and tZq processes are also considered and are simulated using the M ADGRAPH 5aMC@NLO generator at NLO precision in QCD. For the simulated samples corresponding to the 2016 (2017–2018) data-taking periods, the NNPDF v3.0 (v3.1) NLO (NNLO) parton distribution functions (PDFs) are used [64, 65]. For processes simulated at NLO (LO) in QCD with the MADGRAPH 5aMC@NLO generator, events from the ME characterized by different parton mul-
2009.04363v2.pdf|||tiplicities are merged via the FxFx (MLM) prescription [66, 67]. The simulated events at the ME level for both signal and background processes, except for Zjj-EW production, are interfaced with PYTHIA v8.2.2 or higher [68] to simulate the shower and hadronization of partons in the initial and ﬁnal states, along with the underlying event de- scription. The CUETP8M1 tune [69] is used for simulated samples corresponding to the 2016 data-taking period, while the CP5 tune [70] is used for the 2017 and 2018 simulated data. Sim- ulated VBF signal events are interfaced with PYTHIA but, rather than the standard pT-ordered parton shower, the dipole shower is chosen to model the ISR and FSR [71]. The dipole shower correctly takes into account the structure of the colour ﬂow between incoming and outgoing quark lines, and its predictions are found to be in good agreement with NNLO QCD calcula- tions, as reported in Ref. [72]. In contrast, the parton shower (PS), hadronization, and simula- tion of the underlying event for the Zjj-EW process are performed with the HERWIG ++ (2016 simulation) and HERWIG 7 (2017 and 2018) programs [73], as they have shown to better match the observed data compared to the pT-ordered PYTHIA predictions in the description of the ad- ditional hadronic activity in the rapidity range between the two leading jets [74]. The EE5C [69] and CH3 tunes [75] are used in the HERWIG ++ and HERWIG 7 simulated samples, respectively. 5 Event selection The analysis is performed usingps=13 TeV pp collision data collected by the CMS experi- ment from 2016 to 2018, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 137 fb 1. Signal events considered in this analysis are expected to contain two prompt isolated muons, regardless of the targeted Higgs boson production mode. Events are initially selected by the L1
2009.04363v2.pdf|||trigger, re- quiring at least one muon candidate reconstructed in the muon chambers with pT>22 GeV. Events of interest are selected by the HLT using single muon triggers that have a pTthreshold of 27 (24) GeV for data recorded in 2017 (2016, 2018). After passing the trigger selections, each event is required to contain at least two oppositely charged muons with pT>20 GeV,jhj<2.4, and passing certain selection requirements on the number of hits in the silicon tracker and in the muon systems, as well as on the quality of the ﬁtted muon track [35]. Each muon is also required to be isolated in order to reject events with nonprompt or misidentiﬁed muon candidates. The muon isolation variable, as deﬁned in Section 3, is required to be less than 25% of the muon pT. Muons from the Higgs boson decay satisfy these identiﬁcation and isolation requirements with an average selection efﬁciency of about 95%. In addition, at least one of the two muons is required to have pT>29(26)GeV for data collected in 2017 (2016, 2018), ensuring nearly 100% trigger efﬁciency. The sensitivity of this analysis depends primarily on the resolution of the mmmpeak in the signal events. This resolution depends on the precision with which the muon pTis measured, which 6 worsens with increasing muon jhj. The relative pTresolution of muons with pT>20 GeV pass- ing through the barrel region of the detector ( jhj<0.9) ranges from 1.5 to 2%, whereas the pT resolution of muons passing through the endcaps of the muon system ( jhj>1.2) ranges from 2 to 4%. The muon momentum scale and resolution are calibrated in bins of pTandhusing the decay products of known dilepton resonances, following the method described in Ref. [76]. In signal events, the Higgs boson decays into a muon pair at the interaction
2009.04363v2.pdf|||point. Therefore, the precision of the muon pTmeasurement can be improved by including the interaction point as an additional constraint in the muon track ﬁt. This is implemented via an analytical correction to the muon pTproportional to the product of the muon p2 T, its charge, and the minimum dis- tance in the transverse plane between the muon track and the beam position. The correction is derived in simulated Z !mmevents and checked in both data and simulation to provide an equivalent result to reﬁtting the muon track with the interaction point constraint. The resulting improvement in the expected mmmresolution in signal events ranges from 3 to 10%, depending on muon pT,h, and the data-taking period. In a nonnegligible fraction of signal events, a muon from the Higgs boson decay radiates a photon that carries away a signiﬁcant fraction of the muon momentum. If not taken into ac- count, this worsens the resolution of the dimuon invariant mass ( mmm) peak in signal events. Furthermore, if the FSR photon falls in the isolation cone of the corresponding muon candi- date, it can signiﬁcantly increase the value of the isolation sum, thereby creating an inefﬁciency in selecting signal events. Therefore, a procedure is implemented to identify and recover the contribution of FSR photons similar to that described in Ref. [9]. In order to preserve the over- all signal acceptance of the dimuon selection described above, the FSR recovery is applied only to muons with pT>20 GeV andjhj<2.4. Photons with pT>2 GeV andjhj<2.5 that are not associated with reconstructed electrons are considered as FSR photon candidates if they lie inside a cone of R=0.5 around a muon track. These candidates are then required to be loosely isolated and collinear with the muon such that (Sipi T(DR(g,i)<0.3))/pT(g)<1.8 andDR(m,g)/p2 T(g)<0.012, where pT(g)is the pTof
2009.04363v2.pdf|||the FSR photon candidate and the index irefers to the PF candidates other than the muon within a cone of R=0.3 around the photon. In order to suppress possible contaminations from H !Z(mm)gdecays, the ratio between the pTof the FSR photon and that of the associated muon is required to be smaller than 0.4. In the case of multiple FSR candidates associated with a muon, the candidate with the smallest value ofDR(m,g)/p2 T(g)is chosen. The momentum of the photon is added to that of the muon and its contribution to the muon isolation sum is ignored. The FSR recovery increases the signal efﬁciency by about 2% and improves the mmmresolution by about 3%. In order to maximize the analysis sensitivity, event candidates selected with the requirements described above are separated into independent and nonoverlapping classes based on the fea- tures of the ﬁnal state expected from each production mode. Events with b-tagged jets are assigned to the t tH production category, which is further split into the hadronic and leptonic subclasses by the presence of additional charged leptons ( mor e) in the ﬁnal state. Dimuon events with one (two) additional charged lepton(s) and no b-tagged jets are assigned to the WH (ZH) category. Events with neither additional charged leptons nor b-tagged jets belong to the VBF category if a pair of jets is present with large mjjandDhjj. The remaining untagged events, which constitute about 96% of the total sample of dimuon candidate events, belong to the ggH-enriched category. In each production category, multivariate techniques are used to enhance the discrimination between the expected signal and background contributions by further dividing events into several subcategories with different signal-to-background ratios. The measured H!m+m signal is then extracted via a simultaneous maximum-likelihood ﬁt across all event categories to observables chosen for each category
2009.04363v2.pdf|||to maximize the overall mea- 7 surement precision. In the following Sections, each production category is presented in order of decreasing sensitivity. 6 The VBF production category A dimuon event passing the baseline selection detailed in Section 5 is considered in the VBF production category if it contains two or more jets, with the pTof the leading jet ( pT(j1)) larger than 35 GeV, the pTof the second-highest pTjet (pT(j2)) greater than 25 GeV, and the jhjof both jets less than 4.7. Jets overlapping with either of the two selected muons are discarded. In addi- tion, the two highest pTjets in the event are required to have mjj>400 GeV andjDhjjj>2.5. An event is rejected from the VBF category if it contains one (two) jet(s) inside the silicon tracker ﬁducial volume ( jhj<2.5) with pT>25 GeV and identiﬁed as a b quark jet by the medium (loose) WP of the DeepCSV b-tagging algorithm. These requirements suppress the t t and single top quark backgrounds and ensure mutual exclusivity between the VBF and t tH categories. Moreover, events containing an additional muon (electron) with pT>20 GeV and jhj<2.4(2.5)passing the selection criteria described in Section 9 are discarded. This require- ment ensures no overlap between the analyses targeting VBF and VH production. Selected events are further grouped into two independent classes. Events in which the two muons form an invariant mass between 115 and 135 GeV belong to the signal region (VBF-SR), which is en- riched in signal-like events. Events with 110 <mmm<115 GeV or 135 <mmm<150 GeV belong to the mass sideband region (VBF-SB), which is used as a control region to estimate the back- ground. The VBF-SR is deﬁned to be 20 GeV wide in order to be sensitive to Higgs boson mass hypotheses in the range of 120–130 GeV. A

The DNN is implemented using KERAS [77] with TENSORFLOW [78] as backend. The DNN inputs include six variables associated with the production and decay of the dimuon system, namely the mmm, the per-event uncertainty in the measured dimuon mass s(mmm), the dimuon transverse momentum ( pmm T), the dimuon rapidity (ymm), and the azimuthal angle ( fCS) and the cosine of the polar angle (cos qCS) computed in the dimuon Collins–Soper rest frame [79]. The DNN also takes as input a set of variables describing the properties of the dijet system, namely the full momentum vector of the two highest pTjets in the event ( pT(j1),pT(j2),h(j1),h(j2),f(j1), and f(j2)),mjj, andDhjj. In addition, observables sensitive to angular and pTcorrelations between muons and jets are also included, namely the minimum Dhbetween the dimuon system and each of the two leading jets, the Zeppenfeld 8 variable ( z) [80] constructed from ymmand the rapidities of the two jets as z=ymm (yj1+yj2)/2 jyj1 yj2j, (1) and the pT-balance ratio R(pT) =j~pTmm+~pTjjj pmm T+pT(j1) +pT(j2). (2) The VBF signal events are expected to have suppressed hadronic
2009.04363v2.pdf|||activity in the rapidity region between the two leading jets. This feature is exploited by considering “soft track-jets” in the event that are deﬁned by clustering, via the anti- kTalgorithm with a distance parameter of 0.4, charged particles from the primary interaction vertex, excluding the two identiﬁed muons and those associated with the two VBF jets. The use of soft track-jet observables is a robust and validated method to reconstruct the hadronization products of partons with energy as low as a few GeV [81]. The number of soft track-jets in an event with pT>5 GeV, as well as the scalar pTsum of all track-jets with pT>2 GeV, are used as additional input variables. Finally, since jets in signal events are expected to originate from quarks, whereas in the DY process they can also be initiated by gluons, the quark-gluon likelihood [82] of the two leading jets is also used as input to the DNN. The DNN is trained using simulated events from signal (VBF) and background (DY, Zjj-EW, t t, and diboson) processes selected in the VBF-SR. Signal events generated with mH=125 GeV are used in the DNN training. The last hidden layers of four intermediate networks are combined to form a single binary classiﬁer: two networks exploit the full set of variables described above in order to optimize the separation between the VBF signal and the Zjj-EW or DY background, while the other two optimize the separation between the VBF signal and the total expected background. The ﬁrst of the two networks discriminating against the total background uses all the inputs except for mmm, while the second uses only the dimuon mass and its resolution. Every network contains three or four hidden layers, each with a few tens of nodes. All trainings are performed using a four-fold strategy [83],
2009.04363v2.pdf|||where 50% of the events are used for training, 25% for validation, and 25% for testing. The validation sample is used to optimize the DNN hyper-parameters, while the test sample is used to evaluate the DNN performance and for the expected distributions in the signal extraction ﬁt. The selected training epoch maximizes the expected signiﬁcance, determined using the Asimov data set [84], deﬁned as the minimum between the signiﬁcances computed from the training and validation samples. Events belonging to the VBF-SR are divided into nonoverlapping bins based on the DNN value, independently for each data-taking period. These bins are deﬁned to achieve optimal sensitiv- ity, while minimizing the total number of bins. From this optimization procedure, thirteen bins are obtained in each data-taking period characterized by different bin boundaries. Given the negligible correlation between the mmmand other input variables, the mmmvariable can be marginalized from the DNN by replacing the mmmwith a ﬁxed value of 125 GeV during the DNN evaluation. The resulting DNN score is not signiﬁcantly correlated with the mmm. This mass-decorrelated DNN is used for events in the VBF-SB region and captures the main fea- tures of the DNN distribution in the VBF-SR. The signal is extracted from a binned maximum- likelihood ﬁt to the output of the DNN discriminator performed simultaneously over the VBF- SR and VBF-SB regions. Because of signiﬁcant variations in the detector response to forward jets during different data-taking periods, the ﬁt is performed separately for data collected in 2016, 2017, and 2018. The contributions of the various background processes are estimated from simulation, following the same strategy employed in the measurement of the Zjj-EW 9 cross section with 13 TeV data [74]. This simulation-based strategy yields, in the VBF category, an improvement in sensitivity of about 20% compared to an alternative strategy

In this alternative analysis, a multivari- ate classiﬁer is used to divide events into subcategories with different signal purity, and the signal is extracted by ﬁtting the mmmdistribution in each subcategory to parametric functions as in Ref. [23]. In such data-driven analyses, the precision of the background estimate strictly depends on the number of observed events in the mass sidebands, thereby limiting the per- formance in the high purity subcategories that contain a small number of events. In contrast, the approach presented here relies on the precision with which the simulation is able to pre- dict the different background components. The uncertainty in this prediction is validated and constrained using the signal-depleted sideband regions. Theoretical uncertainties affect both the expected rate and the shape of signal and background histograms (templates) used in the ﬁt. The Higgs boson production cross section for the var- ious modes, and their corresponding uncertainties, are taken from Ref. [22]. These include uncertainties in the choice of the PDF, as well as the QCD renormalization ( mR) and factoriza- tion ( mF) scales. The uncertainty in the prediction of B(H!m+m )is also considered. For the VBF process, uncertainties in the modelling of the pT(H),pT(Hjj), jet multiplicity, and mjjdis- tributions are considered. Their total uncertainty on the VBF signal prediction is about 2–4%. Similarly, for the ggH process, seven independent additional sources are included to account for the uncertainty in the modelling of the pT(H)distribution, the number of jets in the event, and its contamination in the VBF selected region, as described in Ref. [22]. The magnitude of these uncertainties for ggH events in the VBF category varies from about 15 to 25%. The theo- retical uncertainties described so far affect also the signal prediction in the ggH,
2009.04363v2.pdf|||t tH, and VH production categories reported in the next Sections. For each background process, template variations are built by changing the values of mRandmFby factors of 2 and 0.5 from the default values used in the ME calculation, excluding the combinations for which mR/mF=0.25 or 4, as well as by comparing the nominal distributions with those obtained using the alternative PDFs of the NNPDF set. These theoretical uncertainties are correlated across years and regions (VBF-SR and VBF-SB) but are uncorrelated between processes. The shape uncertainty arising from the PS model is assessed by varying several parameters that control the properties of the ISR and FSR jets produced by PYTHIA . The Zjj-EW and VBF signal simulations are very sen- sitive to the PS model, as shown in Refs. [72, 74]. A conservative PS uncertainty is assigned to the Zjj-EW background and VBF signal, deﬁned as the full symmetrized difference between PYTHIA (dipole shower) and HERWIG (angular-ordered shower) predictions in each DNN bin, which is larger than that obtained by varying the PS ISR and FSR parameters. Several sources of experimental uncertainty are taken into account for both signal and back- ground processes. These include the uncertainty in the measurement of the integrated lumi- nosity, in the modelling of the pileup conditions during data taking, in the measurement of the muon selection and trigger efﬁciencies, in the muon momentum scale and resolution, in the efﬁciency of vetoing b quark jets, and in the jet energy scale and resolution. If not explic- itly mentioned, experimental uncertainties are considered correlated across event categories and data-taking periods. Most of the sources of uncertainty affecting the jet energy scale are correlated across processes and years, while those affecting the jet energy resolution are only correlated across processes but not across years. The uncertainty in
2009.04363v2.pdf|||the measurement of the in- tegrated luminosity is partially correlated across years. The integrated luminosities of the 2016, 2017, and 2018 data-taking periods are individually known with uncertainties in the 2.3–2.5% range [85–87], while the total integrated luminosity has an uncertainty of 1.8%. The improve- ment in precision reﬂects the (uncorrelated) time evolution of some systematic effects. During 10 the 2016 and 2017 data-taking periods, a gradual shift in the timing of the inputs of the ECAL L1 trigger in the forward endcap region ( jhj>2.4) led to a speciﬁc inefﬁciency. A correction for this effect was determined using an unbiased data sample and is found to be relevant in events with high- pTjets with 2.4 <jhj<3.0. This correction is about 2 (3)% at mjj=400 GeV in the 2016 (2017) data-taking period and it increases to about 6 (9)% for mjj>2 TeV. A systematic uncertainty corresponding to 20% of this correction is considered. Lastly, a signiﬁcant fraction (about 30–35%) of the DY background populating bins with low DNN score is comprised of events in which either the leading or subleading jet are in the forward region of the detector (jhj>3.0) and are not matched with a jet at the generator level. These jets originate either from the soft emissions produced by the PS or from pileup interactions. The normalization of this term is left ﬂoating in the ﬁt and is directly constrained by the observed data events with low DNN score belonging to the VBF-SR and VBF-SB regions. Because of signiﬁcant varia- tions in the detector response in the forward region over time, these normalization parameters are considered uncorrelated across years. The normalization of the remaining DY component with at least two matched jets is taken from the simulation and constrained, as for the other background processes, within the systematic
2009.04363v2.pdf|||uncertainties described above. The uncertainty arising from the limited size of simulated samples is also taken into account by allowing each bin of the total background template to vary within the corresponding sta- tistical uncertainty using the Barlow–Beeston lite technique [88, 89]. These uncertainties are uncorrelated across the bins of the DNN templates used in the ﬁt. Systematic uncertainties are modelled in the ﬁt as nuisance parameters with log-normal or Gaussian external constraints. Figure 1 shows the observed and predicted distributions of the DNN discriminant in the VBF- SR. The background prediction is obtained from a simultaneous signal-plus-background (S+B) ﬁt performed across the VBF-SR and VBF-SB regions, as well as data-taking periods. The post- ﬁt distributions for the Higgs boson signal produced via ggH (solid red) and VBF (solid black) production with mH=125.38 GeV are overlaid. The blue histogram indicates, instead, the to- tal signal extracted from the ﬁt. Similarly, Fig. 2 shows the distributions of the DNN discrimi- nant in the VBF-SB, obtained after performing the same S+B ﬁt. Figure 3 shows the observed and predicted DNN output distributions in the VBF-SB (left) and VBF-SR (right) regions for the combination of 2016, 2017, and 2018 data. Since the bin boundaries are optimized sepa- rately per data-taking period, the distributions are combined by summing the corresponding observed and predicted number of events in each individual bin. The lower panel shows the ratio between the data and the post-ﬁt background prediction, with the best ﬁt signal contribu- tion indicated by the blue line in the VBF-SR. Finally, Table 2 reports, for each bin or group of bins of the DNN output in the VBF-SR, the expected number of VBF and ggH signal events (S), the observed number of events in data, the total background prediction (B) and its uncertainty (DB), and

Events with additional muons or electrons are rejected to avoid overlap with the VH category. Any jets considered in the event must be spatially separated ( DR>0.4) from either of the two muons. In order to ensure mutual exclusivity with the VBF category, events containing two or more jets with pT>25 GeV are only considered if the leading jet has pT<35 GeV, the invariant mass of the two highest pT jets is smaller than 400 GeV, or the jDhjjj<2.5.

A summary of the selection criteria used to deﬁne the ggH category is reported in Table 3. A multivariate discriminant based on boosted decision trees (BDTs) is employed to discrimi- nate between signal and background events. To account for the evolution in the detector re- sponse during data-taking periods, the BDT discriminant is trained separately for the 2016, 2017, and 2018 simulated samples using the TMVA package [90], resulting in

The input variables are chosen such that the BDT discriminants are effectively uncorrelated with mmm. This is required by the chosen analysis strategy, in which events are ﬁrst divided into independent subcategories based on the BDT output, then a potential sig- nal is extracted from each subcategory by searching for a narrow peak over a smoothly falling background in the mmmdistribution. In this category, given the prior knowledge of the expected DY background shape and the large number of data events in the mass sideband around the peak that can be used to constrain the background, this strategy provides a robust background estimate from data while maximizing the analysis sensitivity. The BDT discriminants include input variables that describe the production and decay of the dimuon system, namely pmm T,ymm,fCS, and cos qCS. In addition, the hof each of the two muons and the ratio of each muon’s pTtommmare also included. In order to increase the signal-to- background separation for events in which the ggH signal is produced in association with jets, the BDT discriminants also take into account the pTandhof the leading jet in the event with pT>25 GeV and the absolute distance in hand fbetween the jet and the muon pair. For events with two or more jets with pT>25 GeV in the ﬁnal state, additional inputs are included: the mjj,Dhjj, andDfjjof the two highest pTjets. The mjj, as well as the other dijet variables, is sensitive to the residual contribution from VBF and VH modes, in which the
2009.04363v2.pdf|||vector boson decays hadronically. Furthermore, the Zeppenfeld variable deﬁned in Eq. (1) and the angular separation ( Dh,Df) between the dimuon system and each of the two leading jets are also included, which target residual VBF signal events in the ggH selected region. Lastly, the total number of jets in the event with pT>25 GeV andjhj<4.7 is also used as input to the BDT. The signal simulation considered in the training of the multivariate discriminators includes the ggH, VBF, VH, and t tH processes. The ggH sample used in the training is generated via POWHEG since it provides positively weighted events at NLO in QCD. In later stages of the analysis, the prediction from M ADGRAPH 5aMC@NLO is used instead since it provides a more accurate description of gluon fusion events accompanied by more than one jet, as detailed in Section 4. The background simulation consists of DY, t t, single top quark, diboson, and Zjj-EW processes. Only events with mmmin the range 115–135 GeV are included in the training. Signal and background events both contain two prompt muons in the ﬁnal state, and the correspond- ing dimuon mass resolution ( smm/mmm) does not discriminate between them. For this reason, smm/mmmis not added as an input to the BDT. Instead, signal events in the BDT training are assigned a weight inversely proportional to the expected mass resolution, derived from the uncertainties in the pTmeasurements of the individual muon tracks. This weighting improves the average signal smm/mmmin the high-score BDT region by assigning increased importance to the high-resolution signal events. Apart from mmm, the pmm Tis one of the most discriminating ob- servables in the ggH category. Discrepancies between data and simulation in the pmm Tspectrum for the DY background, similar to those reported in Ref. [91], are also observed in
2009.04363v2.pdf|||this analysis. In order to correctly model the pmm Tspectrum of the DY background during the training of the BDT discriminants, corrections are derived for each data-taking period by reweighting the pmm T 15 distribution of the DY simulation to reproduce the observation in data for dimuon events with 70<mmm<110 GeV. These corrections are obtained separately for events containing zero, one, and two or more jets with pT>25 GeV andjhj<4.7. 1−10110210310410510610710810910Events / 0.09 unitsDataDY Top quark Zjj-EW Diboson Other bkg. ggH VBF Other sig.

The distributions for various signal pro- cesses (ggH, VBF, and VH+t tH) are also shown. Five event subcategories are deﬁned based on the output of these BDT discriminants. The subcategory boundaries are determined via an iterative process that aims to maximize the expected sensitivity of this analysis to H !m+m  decays of the SM Higgs boson. The expected sensitivity is estimated from S+B ﬁts to the mmm distribution in simulated events with 110 <mmm<150 GeV. In these ﬁts, the Higgs boson sig- nal is modelled using a parametric shape, the double-sided Crystal Ball function (DCB) [92] DCB (mmm) =8 >>>< >>>:e (mmm ˆm)2/2s2,  aL<mmm ˆm s<aR nL jaLjnLe a2 L/2 nL jaLj jaLj mmm ˆm s nL,mmm ˆm s aL nR jaRjnRe a2 R/2 nR jaRj jaRj+mmm ˆm s nR,mmm ˆm saR. (3) The core of the DCB function consists of a Gaussian distribution of mean ˆmand standard de- viation s, while the tails on either side are modelled by a power-law function with parameters 16 aLand nL(low-mass tail), and aRand nR(high-mass tail). The total expected background is modelled with a modiﬁed form of the Breit–Wigner function (mBW) [23], mBW (mmm;mZ,GZ,a1,a2,a3) =ea2mmm+a3m2 mm (mmm mZ)a1+ (GZ/2)a1, (4) where the parameters mZandGZare ﬁxed to the measured Z boson mass of 91.19 GeV and width 2.49 GeV [93], and the parameters a1,a2, and a3are free to ﬂoat. A ﬁrst boundary is selected by optimizing the total expected signiﬁcance against all possible boundaries de- ﬁned in quantiles of signal efﬁciency. This strategy accounts for the slight differences in the BDT shapes among data-taking periods for both signal and background processes. This pro- cess is repeated recursively to deﬁne additional subcategory boundaries until the further gain in the expected signiﬁcance is less than 1%. The optimized event categories are labelled as “ggH-cat1”, “ggH-cat2”,
2009.04363v2.pdf|||“ggH-cat3”, “ggH-cat4”, and “ggH-cat5” corresponding to signal efﬁciency quantiles of 0–30, 30–60, 60–80, 80–95, and >95%, respectively. The grey vertical bands in Figure 4 (left) indicate the small range of variation, among the data-taking years, of the BDT boundaries for the optimized event categories described above. A simultaneous binned maximum-likelihood ﬁt to the observed mmmdistributions is performed over the mass range 110–150 GeV to extract the H !m+m signal. A bin size of 50 MeV is cho- sen for the mmmdistributions, which is about one order of magnitude smaller than the expected resolution of the signal peak. In each event category, simulated signal distributions from the different production modes (ggH, VBF, WH, ZH, and t tH) are modelled independently with DCB functions, and the best ﬁt values of the DCB tail parameters are treated as constants in the ﬁnal ﬁt to the data. The ˆmandsparameters of the DCB function represent the peak position and resolution of the Higgs boson resonance, respectively. These are the only signal shape pa- rameters allowed to vary in the ﬁt. Their predicted values from simulation are constrained by Gaussian priors with widths corresponding to the muon momentum scale (up to 0.2%) and res- olution uncertainties (up to 10%) in each event category. Figure 4 (right) shows the total signal model for mH=125 GeV obtained by summing the contributions from the different produc- tion modes in the best and the worst resolution subcategories of the ggH category, ggH-cat4 and ggH-cat1, where HWHM represents the half-width at half maximum of the signal peak. The category with the highest signal purity (ggH-cat5) uses particular kinematic features ( pmm T, DhandDfbetween the dimuon system and jets) to isolate the signal, while ggH-cat4 relies more heavily on the mmmresolution itself. Therefore, the mass resolution for signal events in ggH-cat4 is expected
2009.04363v2.pdf|||to be about 2% better than in ggH-cat5. The theoretical and experimental sources of systematic uncertainties affecting the expected sig- nal rate in each event category are similar to those described in the VBF analysis. Experimental uncertainties in the measurement of the muon selection efﬁciencies (0.5–1% per event cate- gory), jet energy scale (1–4% per event category) and resolution (1–6% per event category), the modelling of the pileup conditions (0.3–0.8% per event category), the integrated luminos- ity, and the efﬁciency for vetoing b quark jets (0.1–0.5% per event category) are considered. Theoretical uncertainties in the prediction of the Higgs boson production cross section, decay rate, and acceptance are also included, corresponding to a total uncertainty in the ggH yield ranging from 6–12% depending on the event category. Rate uncertainties are modelled in the signal extraction as nuisance parameters acting on the relative signal yield with log-normal constraints. The background contribution in each subcategory is modelled with parametric functions. No prior knowledge of the shape parameters of these functions or the yield of the total background 17 is assumed. These parameters are therefore constrained directly by the observed data in the S+B ﬁt. Since the background composition expected from simulation is very similar across sub- categories and largely dominated by the DY process, the background shape in mmmis similar in all event categories. There are, however, variations in the overall slope of the mmmspectrum across the BDT score categories. The function describing the background in each event category is therefore deﬁned as the product of a “core” shape that is common among all event categories, with parameters correlated across categories, and a Chebyshev polynomial term (shape modi- ﬁer) speciﬁc to each event category that modulates the core shape. This background modelling approach is referred to as the “core-pdf method”. The core
2009.04363v2.pdf|||background shape is obtained from an envelope of three distinct functions: the mBW deﬁned in Eq. (4), a sum of two exponen- tials, and the product of a nonanalytical shape derived from the FEWZ v3.1 generator [57] and a third-order Bernstein polynomial. Each of these functions contains three freely ﬂoating shape parameters. The nonanalytical shape derived from the FEWZ generator is obtained by simulat- ing DY events at NNLO precision in QCD and NLO accuracy in EW theory and interpolating the resulting mmmdistribution using a spline function [94, 95]. In a given subcategory, each of the three core functions is modulated by either a third- (ggH-cat1 and ggH-cat2) or a second- order polynomial, with parameters uncorrelated across event categories. A discrete proﬁling method [96] is employed, which treats the choice of the core function used to model the back- ground as a discrete nuisance parameter in the signal extraction. The following strategy is adopted to estimate the uncertainty in the measured signal due to the choice of parametric function for the background model. In each event category, background- only ﬁts to the data are performed using different types of functions: the mBW, a sum of two exponentials, a sum of two power-law functions, a Bernstein polynomial, the product between the nonanalytical shape described above and a Bernstein polynomial, the product between the “BWZ” function, deﬁned as BWZ (mmm;a,mZ,GZ) =GZeammm (mmm mZ)2+ (GZ/2)2, (5) and a Bernstein polynomial, and the “BWZ g” function [97] BWZ g(mmm;a,f,mZ,GZ) =fBWZ (mmm;a,mZ,GZ) + ( 1 f)eammm m2mm. (6) The BWZ gfunction is the sum of a Breit–Wigner function and a 1/ m2 mmterm, which are used to model the Z boson and the photon contributions to the mmmspectrum in DY events, respec- tively. Both terms are multiplied by an exponential function to approximate the effect of the
2009.04363v2.pdf|||PDFs. The BWZ function is a Breit–Wigner distribution with an exponential tail. For the func- tions including Bernstein polynomials, a Fisher test [98] is used to determine the maximum degree of the polynomials to be considered in the ﬁt. The chosen functional forms ﬁt the data with a c2probability larger than 5% in all event categories. Pseudodata sets are generated across all event categories from the post-ﬁt background shapes obtained for each type of function in each subcategory, taking into account the uncertainties in the ﬁt parameters as well as their correlations, and injecting a given number of signal events. Signal-plus-background ﬁts are performed on the pseudodata sets using the core-pdf method. The median difference between the measured and injected signal yields, relative to the post-ﬁt uncertainty in the signal yields, gives an estimate of the bias due to the choice of the back- ground model. The bias measured in each BDT category, as well as from pseudodata sets in which the signal is injected simultaneously in all event categories, is smaller than 20% of the 18 post-ﬁt uncertainty on the signal yield. Including these observed deviations as spurious sig- nals leads to a change in the overall uncertainty in the measured signal rate of less than 1% and is therefore neglected. The core-pdf method employed in this analysis yields an improvement in sensitivity of about 10% with respect to the background functions used in the previous re- sult [23]. It also ensures a negligible bias in the measured signal with signiﬁcantly fewer total degrees of freedom in the signal extraction ﬁt. Figure 5 shows the mmmdistributions in each of the ggH subcategories, in which the signal is extracted by performing a binned maximum-likelihood ﬁt using a DCB function to model the signal contribution, while the background is estimated with

However, the presence of a top quark-antiquark pair in addition to the Higgs boson helps to reduce the background to a level that is comparable to the expected sig- nal rate. The top quark decays predominantly into a b quark and a W boson [93], therefore a sample of events enriched in t tH production is selected by requiring the
2009.04363v2.pdf|||presence of at least two jets passing the loose WP of the DeepCSV b-tagging algorithm, or at least one b-tagged jet passing the medium WP . This requirement suppresses background processes in which jets originate mainly from the hadronization of light-ﬂavour quarks, such as DY and diboson pro- duction. This selection also ensures mutual exclusivity between the t tH category and the other production categories considered in this analysis. In order to increase the signal selection efﬁciency in events with large hadronic activity, as ex- pected for the t tH signal process, the isolation requirement on all muons described in Section 5 is relaxed to be less than 40% of the muon pT. In addition, the isolation cone size decreases dynamically with the muon pT(R=0.2 for pT<50 GeV, R=10/pTfor 50 <pT<200 GeV, and R=0.05 for pT>200 GeV), following the approach used in Ref. [99]. Electron candidates are required to have pT>20 GeV,jhj<2.5, and to pass identiﬁcation requirements imposed on the properties of the ECAL cluster associated with the electron track, as well as the con- sistency between the electron momentum measured by the inner silicon tracker and its ECAL 19 01020304050607080310×Events / GeV (13 TeV)-1137 fbCMS ggH-cat1 = 125.38 GeV HmDataS+B fit Bkg. component σ 1 ±σ 2 ±110 115120125130135140145150 (GeV) µµm400−200−0200400Data-Bkg. 01020304050310×Events / GeV (13 TeV)-1137 fbCMS ggH-cat2 = 125.38 GeV HmDataS+B fit Bkg. component σ 1 ±σ 2 ±110 115120125130135140145150 (GeV) µµm400−200−0200400Data-Bkg. 0246810121416310×Events / GeV (13 TeV)-1137 fbCMS ggH-cat3 = 125.38 GeV HmDataS+B fit Bkg. component σ 1 ±σ 2 ±110 115120125130135140145150 (GeV) µµm200−0200Data-Bkg. 0246810310×Events / GeV (13 TeV)-1137 fbCMS ggH-cat4 = 125.38 GeV HmDataS+B fit Bkg. component σ 1 ±σ 2 ±110 115120125130135140145150 (GeV) µµm200−0200Data-Bkg. 00.20.40.60.811.21.41.61.82310×Events / GeV (13 TeV)-1137 fbCMS ggH-cat5 = 125.38 GeV HmDataS+B fit Bkg. component σ 1 ±σ 2 ±110 115120125130135140145150 (GeV) µµm100−50−050100Data-Bkg.

The one (green) and two (yellow) standard deviation bands include the uncertainties in the background component of the ﬁt. The lower panel shows the residuals after background subtraction and the red line indicates the signal with mH=125.38 GeV extracted from the ﬁt. 20 energy deposit. Each electron is also required to be isolated following the same strategy as for muons, and the magnitude of the transverse and longitudinal impact parameters must be smaller than 0.05 and 0.1 cm, respectively. In order to suppress backgrounds containing non- prompt leptons produced in the decay of heavy quarks, muons and electrons are rejected when the jet with pT>15 GeV that is nearest to the lepton in DRseparation is b-tagged according to the DeepCSV medium WP . Furthermore, all muons and electrons in the t tH category are re- quired to pass the medium WP of a multivariate lepton identiﬁcation discriminant speciﬁcally designed to reject nonprompt leptons [100], resulting in a selection efﬁciency of about 95 (92)% per prompt muon (electron). The t tH signal events may contain additional charged leptons, depending on the decay of the top quarks. Events with one or two additional charged leptons in the ﬁnal state are grouped in the t tH leptonic category. An event in the t tH leptonic category containing three (four) charged leptons is further required to have the net sum of the lepton electric charges equal to one (zero). In the case of events with more than one pair of oppositely charged muons with 110 <mmm<150 GeV, the pair with the largest dimuon pTis chosen as the Higgs boson candidate. The invariant mass of each pair of same-ﬂavour, opposite-sign leptons is required to
2009.04363v2.pdf|||be greater than 12 GeV to suppress backgrounds arising from quarkonium decays. An event is vetoed if it contains a pair of oppositely charged electrons or muons with an invariant mass in the range 81–101 GeV, consistent with the decay of an on-shell Z boson. In contrast, events with exactly two oppositely charged muons with 110 <mmm<150 GeV, no identiﬁed electrons, and at least one combination of three jets in the ﬁnal state with invariant mass ( mjjj) between 100 and 300 GeV belong to the t tH hadronic category. Each jet must have pT>25 GeV andjhj<4.7. A summary of the selection criteria used to deﬁne the t tH hadronic and leptonic categories is reported in Table 5. Table 5: Summary of the kinematic requirements used to deﬁne the t tH hadronic and leptonic production categories Observable t tH hadronic t tH leptonic Number of b quark jets >0 medium or >1 loose b-tagged jets Number of leptons (N (`=m, e)) =2 =3 or 4 Lepton charge ( q(`)) åq(`) =0 N (`) =3(4)!åq(`) =1(0) Jet multiplicity ( pT>25 GeV,jhj<4.7)3 2 Leading jet pT >50 GeV >35 GeV Z boson veto — jm`` mZj>10 GeV Low-mass resonance veto — m``>12 GeV Jet triplet mass 100 <mjjj<300 GeV — The dominant background in the t tH hadronic category comes from fully leptonic t t decays, while the main backgrounds in the t tH leptonic category are the t tZ and t t processes. In or- der to obtain an optimal discrimination between the t tH signal and the expected backgrounds, BDT-based multivariate discriminants are trained in both the hadronic and leptonic categories. The input variables are chosen to account for both the kinematic properties of the dimuon system and the properties of the top quark decay products, while ensuring that the BDT
2009.04363v2.pdf|||out- puts remain uncorrelated with mmm. A common set of observables is used as input to the two BDT discriminants. These include variables that characterize the production and decay of the Higgs boson candidate, namely the pmm T,ymm,fCS, and cos qCS. In addition, the hof each of the two muons and the ratio of each muon’s pTtommmare also considered. To account for the large hadronic activity in t tH signal events, the pTand hof the three leading jets, the maximum DeepCSV value of jets not overlapping with charged leptons ( DR(`,j)>0.4), the number of jets, and the scalar (vectorial) pTsum HT(j~Hmiss Tj) of all identiﬁed leptons and jets 21 (pT>25 GeV,jhj<2.5) are included. The pmiss Tis also considered along with the Dzvari- able [101], which is deﬁned as the projection of the ~pmiss Ton the bisector of the dimuon system in the transverse plane. Signal events are weighted during the BDT training with the inverse of the per-event mass resolution, following the same approach used in the ggH categories. In the t tH leptonic category, several additional variables are used in the BDT discriminant that target the kinematic properties of a leptonic top quark decay. These include the azimuthal separation between the Higgs boson candidate and the highest pTadditional charged lepton (`t), the invariant mass formed by `tand the jet with the highest DeepCSV score, the transverse mass formed by `tand~pmiss Tin the event, and the ﬂavour of `t. In the t tH hadronic category, the resolved hadronic top tagger (RHTT), which combines a kinematic ﬁt and a BDT-based multivariate discriminant, is used to identify top quark decays to three resolved jets following a similar approach to the one reported in Ref. [102]. The jet triplet with 100 <mjjj<300 GeV and the highest RHTT score is selected as a hadronic
2009.04363v2.pdf|||top quark candidate. The corresponding RHTT score is used as input to the BDT discriminant. Furthermore, the pTof the top quark candidate and the pTbalance of the top quark and the muon pair are also considered. Figure 6 shows the output of the BDT discriminant in the t tH hadronic (left) and leptonic (right) categories. The high BDT score region of the t tH hadronic category is enriched in events with large jet multiplicity, where the t t and DY background predictions rely on a sig- niﬁcant number of jets from the PS and are known to not entirely reproduce the data [103]. The signal prediction, however, relies largely on jets derived from the ME calculation. Since the background prediction is extracted from the data, the observed differences between data and background simulation do not affect the ﬁt result. Based on the BDT output, events in the ttH leptonic category are further divided into two subcategories, labelled as “t tHlep-cat1” and “ttHlep-cat2”, corresponding to signal efﬁciency quantiles of 0–52 and >52%, respectively. Similarly, events in the t tH hadronic category are divided into three subcategories labelled “ttHhad-cat1”, “t tHhad-cat2”, and “t tHhad-cat3”, corresponding to signal efﬁciency quan- tiles of 0–70, 70–86, and >86%, respectively. The BDT score boundaries of these event cat- egories, indicated in Fig. 6 by black dashed vertical lines, are optimized following the same strategy adopted for events in the ggH category. In the optimization, exponential functions are used to model the background in both the ttH hadronic and leptonic subcategories. Figure 7 shows the mmmdistributions in the t tH hadronic and leptonic event categories. The sig- nal is extracted by performing a binned maximum-likelihood ﬁt to these mmmdistributions (bin size of 50 MeV), where signal is modelled using the DCB function and the background is mod-

Table 6 reports the expected signal composition of each t tH subcate- gory, along with the HWHM of the expected signal shape. In addition, the estimated number of background events, the observation in data, and the S/(S+B) and S/p B ratios within the HWHM of the signal shape are shown. The systematic uncertainties considered account for possible mismodelling of the signal shape and rate. Uncertainties in the calibration of the muon momentum scale and resolution are propagated to the shape of the signal mmmdistribution, yielding variations of up to 0.1% in the peak position and up to 10% in width. Experimental uncertainties from the measurement of the electron and muon selection efﬁciencies (0.5–1.5% per event category), muon momentum scale and resolution (0.1–0.8% per event category), jet energy scale and resolution (2–6% per event category), efﬁciency of identifying b quark jets (1–3% per event category), integrated luminosity, and modelling of the pileup conditions (0.2–1% per event category) affect the pre- 22 2−101−10110210310410510610710EventsDataTop quark DY ttZ ttW(W) Other bkg.

Furthermore, theoretical uncertainties in the prediction of the Higgs boson production cross sections, decay rate, and acceptance are also included, as already described for the ggH, VBF, and VH analyses. Rate uncertainties are included in the signal extraction as nuisance parameters acting on the relative signal yield with log-normal constraints. In order to estimate the potential bias arising from the choice of the parametric function used to model the background, alternative functions able to ﬁt the data with a c2p-value larger than 5% are considered. These include Bernstein polynomials, sum of exponentials, and sum of power

From each of these ﬁts, pseudodata sets are generated taking into account the uncertainties in the ﬁt parameters and their correlations, and injecting a certain number of signal events. A S+B ﬁt is then performed on these pseudodata sets using, in each category, the parametric functions listed above. The corresponding bias is observed to be smaller than 20% of the post-ﬁt uncertainty on the signal yield and is therefore neglected in the signal extraction. 23 The chosen functions maximize the expected sensitivity to the 125 GeV Higgs boson. 9 The VH production category Events considered in the VH category contain at least two muons passing the selection require- ments listed in Section 5. In order to ensure no overlap with the t tH category, events containing at least two b-tagged jets with pT>25 GeV andjhj<2.5 passing the loose WP of the DeepCSV b-tagging algorithm, or at least one jet passing the medium WP , are discarded. Events are also required to have at least one additional charged lepton (electron or muon), which is ex- pected from the leptonic decay of the W or Z boson. The additional muons (electrons) must have pT>20 GeV,jhj<2.4(2.5), and pass certain isolation and identiﬁcation requirements with an average efﬁciency of 95 (90)%. Furthermore, all muons and electrons in this category are required to pass the medium WP of a multivariate discriminant developed in Ref. [100] to identify and suppress nonprompt leptons, with a selection efﬁciency of about 95 (92)% per prompt muon (electron). Events containing exactly one additional charged lepton belong to the WH category, which targets signal events where the Higgs boson is produced in association with a leptonically decaying W boson. If the additional lepton is
2009.04363v2.pdf|||a muon, the two pairs of oppositely charged muons are required to have mmm>12 GeV to suppress background events from quarkonium decays. Moreover, neither of the two oppositely charged muon pairs can have an invariant mass consistent with mZwithin 10 GeV. Finally, at least one of these two muon pairs must have mmmin the range 110–150 GeV. If both mmmpairs satisfy this criterion, the pair with the highest pmm Tis considered as the Higgs boson candidate. If the additional lepton is an electron, the only requirement imposed is that 110 <mmm<150 GeV. The ZH category targets signal events where the Higgs boson is produced in association with a Z boson that decays to a pair of electrons or muons. Events in the ZH category are therefore required to contain four charged leptons, with a combined lepton number and electric charge of zero. As in the WH category, the invariant mass of each pair of same-ﬂavour, opposite-sign leptons is required to be greater than 12 GeV. An event is rejected if it does not contain exactly one pair of same-ﬂavour, opposite-sign leptons with invariant mass compatible with the Z boson within 10 (20) GeV for muon (electron) pairs. In addition, each event must contain one oppositely charged muon pair satisfying 110 <mmm<150 GeV. For events with four muons, the muon pair with mmmcloser to mZis chosen as the Z boson candidate, while the other muon pair is selected as the Higgs boson candidate. A summary of the selection criteria applied in the WH and ZH production categories is reported in Table 7. Two BDT discriminants are trained to discriminate between signal and background events in the WH and ZH categories. The input variables are selected such that the BDT outputs are not signiﬁcantly correlated with the mmmof the Higgs boson candidate.
2009.04363v2.pdf|||This is required by the chosen analysis strategy, which is analogous to that adopted for the signal extraction in the ggH category. The impact of the mmmresolution, which evolves as a function of muon pT and h, is taken into account during the BDT training by applying weights to the simulated signal events that are inversely proportional to the per-event mass resolution, estimated from the uncertainty in the measured mmmfollowing the same strategy described in Section 7 and 8. The BDT discriminant used in the WH category takes as inputs several variables that exploit the kinematic features of the three charged leptons in the event, as well as the pmiss T. These variables include the full kinematic information, apart from the invariant mass, of the dimuon system corresponding to the Higgs boson candidate.

2009.04363v2.pdf|||the WH (left) and ZH (right) categories. Based on these outputs, events in the WH category are further divided into three subcategories termed “WH-cat1”, “WH-cat2”, and “WH-cat3” corresponding to signal efﬁciency quantiles of 0–22, 22–70, >70%, respectively. Similarly, events in the ZH category are divided into two subcategories, labelled “ZH-cat1” and “ZH-cat2” corresponding to signal efﬁciency quantiles of 0–52 and >52%, respectively. The boundaries of these subcategories, deﬁned in terms of the BDT discriminant and indicated in Fig. 8 by black dashed vertical lines, are chosen via the same optimization strategy adopted in the ggH and t tH categories. In the VH category, the BWZ function is used to estimate the total background instead of mBW. Figure 9 shows the mmmdistributions in the WH and ZH event categories. The signal is extracted via a binned maximum-likelihood ﬁt in each event category, where the signal is modelled with a DCB function and the background is modelled with the BWZ gfunction in WH-cat1, as deﬁned in Eq. (6) and the BWZ function in the remaining subcategories, as de- ﬁned in Eq. (5).

In addition, the estimated number of back- ground events, the S/(S+B) and S/p B ratios, and the observation in data within the HWHM of the signal peak are also listed. The systematic uncertainties considered in this category account for possible mismodelling in the signal shape and rate. The shape of the reconstructed Higgs boson resonance, modelled using the DCB function deﬁned in Eq. (3), is affected by the uncertainty in the muon momen- tum scale and resolution.

Experimental systematic uncertainties from the measurement of the electron and muon selection efﬁciencies (1–3% per event category), jet energy scale and resolution (0.5– 2% per event category), the efﬁciency of vetoing b quark jets (1–3% per event category), the integrated luminosity, and the pileup model (0.5–2% per event category) affect the predicted signal rate. Furthermore, theoretical uncertainties in the prediction of the Higgs boson produc- tion cross section, decay rate, and acceptance are also considered. Rate uncertainties are taken into account in the signal extraction as nuisance parameters acting on the relative signal yield with log-normal constraints. The potential bias due to the choice of the parametric function used to model the background is estimated using the same procedure employed in the t tH analysis, detailed in Section 8. The set of parametric functional forms considered in the bias studies includes BWZ, BWZ g, sum of exponentials, Bernstein polynomials, and sum of power laws. The chosen parametrization maximizes the expected sensitivity without introducing a signiﬁcant bias in the measured sig- nal yield. The corresponding bias is found to be smaller than 20% and is therefore neglected 27 in the signal extraction. The chosen functions maximize the expected sensitivity to the 125 GeV Higgs boson. 10 Results A simultaneous ﬁt is performed across all event categories, with a single overall signal strength modiﬁer ( m) free to ﬂoat in the ﬁt. The signal strength modiﬁer is deﬁned as the ratio be- tween the observed Higgs boson rate in the H !m+m decay channel and the SM expectation, m= (sB(H!m+m ))obs/(sB(H!m+m ))SM. The relative contributions from the different Higgs boson production modes are ﬁxed to the SM prediction within uncertainties. Conﬁdence intervals on the signal strength are estimated using a proﬁle likelihood ratio test statistic [84], in which systematic uncertainties are modelled as
2009.04363v2.pdf|||nuisance parameters following a modiﬁed frequentist approach [104]. The proﬁle likelihood ratio is deﬁned as qm= 2DlnL= 2 lnL(datajm,ˆqm) L(datajˆm,ˆq), where ˆmrepresents the value of the signal strength that maximizes the likelihood Lfor the data, while ˆqand ˆqmdenote the best ﬁt estimate for the nuisance parameters and the estimate for a given ﬁxed value of m, respectively. Theoretical uncertainties affecting the signal predic- tion are correlated among all the event categories included in the ﬁt. Similarly, experimental uncertainties in the measurement of the integrated luminosity in each year, jet energy scale and resolution, b quark jet identiﬁcation, modelling of the pileup conditions, and selection ef- ﬁciencies of muons and electrons are also correlated across categories. Because of the different analysis strategy employed in the VBF category, the acceptance uncertainties from the muon energy scale and resolution are correlated only among the ggH, WH, ZH, and t tH categories. Furthermore, their effect on the position and width of the signal peak are assumed to be uncor- related across event categories. The local p-value quantiﬁes the probability for the background to produce a ﬂuctuation larger than the apparent signal observed in the search region. Figure 10 (left) shows the observed local p-value for the combined ﬁt, and for each individual production category, as a function ofmHin a 5 GeV window around the expected Higgs boson mass. The solid markers indicate the mass points for which the observed p-values are computed. Figure 10 (right) shows the expected p-values computed for the combined ﬁt, and for each production category, on an Asi- mov data set [84] generated from the background expectation obtained from the S+B ﬁt with amH=125.38 GeV signal injected. The observed p-values as a function mHare compatible, within the statistical variation, with the expectation for the Higgs boson with mH=125.38 GeV. In the ggH,
2009.04363v2.pdf|||VH, and t tH categories, in order to evaluate p-values for masses different from 125 GeV, signal models are derived using alternative H !m+m signal samples generated with mHﬁxed to 120 and 130 GeV. Signal shape parameters and the expected rate for each production mode in each event category are then interpolated using a spline function within 120<mH<130 GeV, providing a signal model for any mass value in the mH=1255 GeV range. A different strategy is employed in the VBF category since mmmis a DNN input variable. As described in Section 6, the DNN output can be decorrelated from the mmminformation by ﬁx- ing its value to 125 GeV. Therefore, a potential signal with mass m0different from 125 GeV can be extracted by ﬁtting the data with an alternative set of signal and background templates, ob- tained by shifting the mass value used as input to the DNN evaluation by Dm=125 GeV m0 and adjusting the expected signal yields by the corresponding differences in the production cross section and decay rate.

The statistical component of the post-ﬁt uncertainty is separated by performing a likelihood scan as a function of min which nuisance parameters associated with systematic uncertainties are ﬁxed to their best ﬁt values. The systematic un- certainty component is then taken as the difference in quadrature between the total and the statistical uncertainties. The individual contributions to the uncertainty in the measured sig- nal strength from experimental uncertainties, the limited size of the simulated samples, and theoretical uncertainties are also evaluated following a similar procedure. The individual un- certainty components are summarized in Table 9. The uncertainty in the measured signal rate is dominated by the limited number of events in data. Figure 11 (left) reports a summary of the best ﬁt values for the signal strength and the corre- sponding 68% CL intervals obtained from a proﬁle likelihood scan in each production category. The best ﬁt signal strengths in each production category are consistent with the combined ﬁt result as well as the SM expectation. A likelihood scan is performed in which the four main 30 Higgs boson production mechanisms are associated to either fermion (ggH and t tH) or vec- tor boson (VBF and VH) couplings.

The signal strength measured in the H !m+m analysis cannot be trans- lated directly into a measurement of the Higgs boson coupling to muons because it is also sensitive to the interactions between the Higgs boson and several SM particles involved in the production processes considered, primarily the top quark and vector boson couplings. These Higgs boson couplings to other particles are constrained by combining the result of this anal- ysis with those presented in Ref. [10], based on pp collision data recorded by the CMS exper- iment atps=13 TeV in 2016 corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb 1. Under the assumption that there are no new particles contributing to the Higgs boson total width, Higgs boson production and decay rates in each category are expressed in terms of coupling modiﬁers within the k-framework [107]. Six free coupling parameters are introduced in the likelihood function ( kW,kZ,kt,kt,kb, and km) and are extracted from a simultaneous ﬁt across all event categories. In the combined ﬁt, the event categories of theps=13 TeV H!m+m  analysis described in this paper supersede those considered in Ref. [10]. Figure 14 (left) shows the observed proﬁle likelihood ratio as a function of kmformH=125.38 GeV. The best ﬁt value forkm(km=1.07), as well as those for the other couplings, are

Note that the observed (expected) signiﬁcances reported in Table 10 and Fig. 10 are computed assuming SM production cross sections and decay rates, con- strained within the corresponding theoretical uncertainties. In the result presented in Fig. 14 (left), the freely ﬂoating coupling modiﬁers are allowed to simultaneously modify both Higgs boson production cross sections and decay rates within the constraint of keeping the total Higgs boson width ﬁxed to the SM value. In the SM, the Yukawa coupling between the Higgs boson and the fermions ( lF) is proportional to the fermion mass ( mF), while the coupling to weak bosons ( gV) is proportional to the square of the vector boson masses ( mV). The results from the k-framework ﬁt can therefore be trans- lated in terms of reduced coupling strength modiﬁers, deﬁned as yV=pkVmV/nfor weak bosons and yF=kFmF/nfor fermions, where nis the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs ﬁeld of 246.22 GeV [93]. Figure 14 (right) shows the best ﬁt estimates for the six reduced cou- pling strength modiﬁers as a function of particle mass, where lepton, vector boson, and quark masses are taken from Ref. [93]. The compatibility between the measured coupling strength modiﬁers and their SM expectation is derived from the  2Dln(L)separation between the best ﬁt and an alternative one, performed by ﬁxing the six coupling modiﬁers to the SM prediction (kW=kZ=kt=kt=kb=km=1), yielding a p-value of 44%. 11 Summary Evidence for Higgs boson decay to a pair of muons is presented. This result combines searches in four exclusive categories targeting the production of the Higgs boson via gluon fusion, via vector boson fusion, in association with a vector boson, and in association with

The main contribution to this result is from processes in which Higgs bosons are produced in association with a W or Z boson (VH), and are searched for in ﬁnal states including 0, 1, or 2 charged leptons and two identiﬁed bottom quark jets. The results from the measurement of these processes in a data sample recorded by the CMS experiment in 2017, comprising 41.3 fb 1of proton-proton collisions atps=13 TeV, are described. When combined with previous VH measurements using data collected atps=7, 8, and 13 TeV, an excess of events is observed at mH= 125 GeV with a signiﬁcance of 4.8 standard deviations, where the expectation for the SM Higgs boson is 4.9. The corresponding measured signal strength is 1.01 0.22. The combination of this result with searches by the CMS experiment for H !bb in other production processes yields an observed (expected) signiﬁcance of 5.6 (5.5) standard deviations and a signal strength of 1.04 0.20.

Observation of Higgs boson decays in the gg, ZZ, WW, and ttmodes have been reported [10– 20], and all measured properties [21–29]
1808.08242v2.pdf|||support this hypothesis. Recently, the CMS and AT- LAS Collaborations reported observations of the Higgs boson produced in association with a top quark pair that are compatible with the SM prediction, representing the ﬁrst direct mea- surements of the Higgs boson coupling to quarks [30, 31]. The decay H!bb, with a predicted branching fraction of about 58% [32] for a Higgs boson mass of mH=125 GeV, is the most prevalent decay mode but has not yet been established unequivocally. A precise measurement of the rate for this process directly probes the Yukawa coupling of the Higgs boson to a down-type quark, and provides a necessary test of the hy- pothesis that the Higgs ﬁeld is the source of mass generation in the charged fermion sector of the SM [33, 34]. At both the LHC and the Tevatron the most sensitive production process in the search for H!bb decays is when the Higgs boson is produced in association with a vector boson (VH). The CDF and D0 Collaborations at the Tevatron reported an excess of events in this channel with a signiﬁcance of 2.8 standard deviations ( s) at a mass of mH=125 GeV [35]. Last year, the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations reported evidence for the VH, H !bb process at a mass of mH=125 GeV corresponding to observed (expected) signiﬁcances of 3.6 (4.0) sand 3.8 (3.8) s, respectively, combining data collected during Run 1 atps=7 and 8 TeV, and Run 2 at 13 TeV [36, 37]. Searches for the H !bb decay in other production processes, with less sensitivity than VH, have also been reported at the LHC [38–44]. In this Letter we present an observation of the Higgs boson decay to bottom quarks. The mea- surement described here examines the VH production process, where the Higgs boson is pro-
1808.08242v2.pdf|||duced in association with a W or Z boson and decays into b b. The data comprise proton-proton (pp) collisions recorded atps=13 TeV by the CMS detector at the LHC in 2017, correspond- ing to a total integrated luminosity of 41.3 fb 1[45]. Five distinct ﬁnal states are considered: Z(nn)H, W (mn)H, W (en)H, Z(mm)H, and Z (ee)H, corresponding to three channels with 0, 1, or 2 charged leptons from the vector boson decay. In addition, two identiﬁed jets due to hadroniza- tion of bottom quarks (b jets) from the Higgs boson decay are required. Important background processes include the production of W and Z bosons in association with jets (V+jets), produc- tion of top quark pairs (t t) and single top quarks (t), diboson (WW, WZ, ZZ), and multijet (QCD) events. The analysis presented here closely follows the methods previously used to search for the VH, H!bb process [37] and incorporates several improvements, including more efﬁcient identiﬁ- cation of b jets, better dijet mass resolution, and the use of different multivariate discriminant techniques that better separate signal from background. For each channel, a signal region en- riched in VH events is selected together with several control regions, each enriched in events from individual background processes. A simultaneous binned-likelihood ﬁt to the shape and yield (normalization) of speciﬁc distributions for the signal and control regions for all channels combined is used to extract a possible Higgs boson signal. To validate the procedure, the same methodology is used to extract a signal for the associated production process VZ, with Z !bb, which has an identical ﬁnal state to VH with H !bb, but with a production cross section 5 to 15 times larger, depending on the kinematic regime considered. The result from this measure- ment is combined with those of similar measurements
1808.08242v2.pdf|||performed by the CMS Collaboration using 2016 data and Run 1 data, in the VH and other production processes. This combination leads to an observation of the Higgs boson decay to bottom quarks. An observation of this decay mode by the ATLAS Collaboration [46] was submitted for publication at the same time 2 as this Letter. The central feature of the CMS apparatus is a superconducting solenoid of 6 m internal diame- ter, providing a magnetic ﬁeld of 3.8 T. A silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter, and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter, each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections, reside within the solenoid. Forward calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. Muons are detected in gas-ionization chambers embedded in the steel ﬂux-return yoke outside the solenoid. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a deﬁnition of the coordinate system and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in [47]. Signal and background processes are simulated with several Monte Carlo (MC) event genera- tors, while the CMS detector response is modeled with G EANT 4 [48]. The quark-induced ZH and WH signal processes are generated at next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD accuracy using the POWHEG v2 [49–51] event generator extended with the MiNLO procedure [52, 53], while the gluon-induced ZH process is generated at leading order (LO) accuracy with POWHEG v2. The Higgs boson mass is set to 125 GeV for all signal samples. Diboson background events are generated with M ADGRAPH 5aMC@NLO v2.4.2 [54] at NLO with the FxFx merging scheme [55] and up to two additional partons. The same generator is used at LO accuracy with the MLM matching scheme [56] to generate V+jets events in inclusive and b-quark enriched conﬁgura- tions with
1808.08242v2.pdf|||up to four additional partons, and to generate a sample of QCD events. The t t [57] and single t production processes in the tW [58] and t [59] channels are generated to NLO accuracy with POWHEG v2, while the s channel [60] single t process is generated with M AD- GRAPH 5aMC@NLO v2.4.2. The parton distribution functions used to produce all samples are the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) NNPDF3.1 set [61]. For parton showering and had- ronization, the matrix element generators are interfaced with PYTHIA v8.230 [62]. For all sam- ples, simulated additional pp interactions (pileup) are added to the hard-scattering process with the multiplicity distribution matched to the 2017 data. The production cross sections for the signal samples are rescaled as a function of the vector boson transverse momentum, pT(V), to NNLO QCD + NLO electroweak accuracy combining the VHNNLO [63–66], VH@NNLO [67, 68], and HAWK v2.0 [69] generators as described in [32]. The production cross sections for the t t samples are rescaled to the NNLO prediction with the next-to-next-to-leading-log result obtained from T OP++ v2.0 [70], while the V+jets samples are rescaled to the NNLO cross sections using FEWZ 3.1 [71]. In the V+jets samples used in this analysis, the pT(V)spectrum in data is observed to be softer than in simulated samples, as expected from higher-order electroweak corrections to the production processes [72]. Events in each channel are reweighted to account for electroweak corrections to pT(V), which reach up to 10% for pT(V)near 400 GeV. In addition, a differential LO-to-NLO correction is applied as a function of the separation in hbetween the two jets from the Higgs boson decay [37]. The tt samples are reweighted as a function of top quark pTto account for the known difference between data and simulation [73]. The CMS particle-ﬂow (PF) event
1808.08242v2.pdf|||algorithm [74] is used to reconstruct and identify individ- ual particles (PF objects) with an optimized combination of information from the various ele- ments of the CMS detector. This algorithm is employed at the trigger level, and in the more detailed reconstruction of data that occurs ofﬂine. The objects identiﬁed by the algorithm com- prise candidate electrons, muons, photons, and charged as well as neutral hadrons. Jets are reconstructed from PF objects using the anti- kTclustering algorithm [75] implemented in the FASTJET package [76, 77], with a distance parameter of 0.4. The missing transverse momen- tum vector ~pmiss Tis deﬁned as the negative vectorial pTsum of all the PF objects identiﬁed in 3 the event, and its magnitude is referred to as pmiss T. The reconstructed vertex with the largest value of summed physics-object p2 Tis considered to be the primary pp interaction vertex. The physics objects used in this calculation are jets clustered using the jet ﬁnding algorithm with the tracks assigned to the vertex as inputs, and the associated missing transverse momentum computed as the negative vectorial pTsum of those jets. All charged hadrons that originate from pileup are removed from consideration in the event. In addition, the average neutral energy density from pileup is evaluated from PF objects and subtracted from the reconstructed jets as well as from the summed energy in the vicinity of leptons (isolation), as described in [74]. Events of interest are selected online using a two-tiered trigger system [78] based on custom hardware processors and a farm of commercial processors running a version of the full ofﬂine reconstruction software optimized for speed. Events in the 0-lepton channel are selected pri- marily by a trigger requiring both pmiss Tand Hmiss Tto be larger than 120 GeV, where Hmiss Tis deﬁned as the magnitude of
1808.08242v2.pdf|||the negative vectorial pTsum of all jets. Single-lepton triggers are used to select events in the 1-lepton channel, where the leptons are required to be isolated from other PF objects. The single-muon trigger requires pT>27 GeV, while the single-electron trig- ger requires pT>32 GeV. For the 2-lepton channel, dilepton triggers are employed with mini- mum pTrequirements of (17, 8)GeV for the two muons and (23, 12 )GeV for the two electrons. After ofﬂine requirements, the 0-lepton trigger efﬁciency reaches 100% above pmiss T220 GeV, while the 1-lepton triggers have efﬁciencies of approximately 95% for muons and 90% for elec- trons, and the dilepton trigger efﬁciency is approximately 91% for muons and 96% for electrons. Events are selected ofﬂine based on the presence of 0, 1, or 2 leptons (muons or electrons) and two identiﬁed b jets. Muons and electrons from W or Z boson decays are identiﬁed using the selection criteria deﬁned in [37], including stringent quality and isolation requirements. The lepton pTrequirements are pT>25(30)GeV for muons (electrons) in the 1-lepton channel, and pT>20 GeV for each lepton in the 2-lepton channel. In the 0- and 1-lepton channels, events with additional isolated muons or electrons are rejected. Minimum pTrequirements of (60, 35 ), (25, 25 ), and (20, 20 )GeV are applied on the two jets forming the Higgs boson candidate in the 0-, 1-, and 2-lepton channels, respectively, which are also required to satisfy jhj<2.5. The reconstruction of vector boson decays differs by channel. In the 0-lepton channel, pmiss Tis interpreted as the pTof the Z boson, while in the 2-lepton channel the Z boson is reconstructed directly from lepton pairs requiring an invariant mass in the range 75–105 GeV. In the 1-lepton channel, the W boson candidate is reconstructed from the ~pTof the single isolated lepton and ~pmiss
1808.08242v2.pdf|||T. Higgs boson candidates are reconstructed from the pair of jets (“jj”) in the event most likely to originate from b quarks, as determined by a combined secondary vertex algorithm (deepCSV) based on a deep neural network discriminant (DNN) [79]. The deepCSV algorithm provides a continuous discriminator score combining information about tracks displaced from the pri- mary vertex, identiﬁed secondary vertices, jet kinematic variables, and information related to the presence of soft leptons in the jet. Of the two jets forming the Higgs boson candidate, the one with a larger deepCSV score is required to satisfy a tight working point with misidenti- ﬁcation rate of 0.1% for light quark and gluon jets, while the jet with a lower deepCSV score (DCSV2) must satisfy a loose working point with a 10% misidentiﬁcation rate. All backgrounds are substantially reduced by requiring large pT(V)[80]. The requirements are pmiss T>170 GeV and pT(V)>150 GeV in the 0- and 1-lepton channels, respectively, while two regions are used in the 2-lepton channel: 50 <pT(V)150 GeV and pT(V)>150 GeV. Resid- 4 ual backgrounds from t t and QCD processes are reduced in the 1-lepton channel by rejecting events with more than one extra jet satisfying pT>30 GeV andjhj<2.5, and in the 0-lepton channel with additional requirements on the angular separation between ~pmiss Tand its nearest jet. After all event selection criteria are applied, the resolution on the dijet invariant mass m(jj) of reconstructed Higgs boson decays is approximately 15%. The mass resolution is improved by applying a multivariate regression technique similar to that employed in [37], with a DNN trained on b jets from simulated t t events with input variables that include several properties of any secondary vertices in the jet, as well as the energy and composition of the jet. In addition, recovery of ﬁnal-state
1808.08242v2.pdf|||radiation is achieved by adding to the m(jj)calculation the momenta of jets near to either of the Higgs boson candidate jets. In the 2-lepton channel, with no genuine ~pmiss Tfrom the hard-scattering process, a kinematic ﬁt of the entire event is performed requir- ingpTbalance between the dilepton and dijet systems within the experimental uncertainty. All three improvements are validated in data by studying the pT(``)/pT(jj)distribution in sam- ples of Z!``events containing at least one b-tagged jet, and by studying the top quark mass distribution in a high-purity sample of t t events. After these improvements, the average resolu- tion on m(jj)is in the 10–13% range, depending on the channel and the pTof the reconstructed Higgs boson. For each channel, a signal region enriched in VH events is selected together with several con- trol regions, each enriched in events from individual background processes. The signal regions are deﬁned as 60 <m(jj)<160 GeV in the 0-lepton channel, and 90 <m(jj)<150 GeV in the 1- and 2-lepton channels. The score of a DNN for events in each of these signal regions, which further separates signal from background, is used in the signal extraction ﬁt. The DNNs are trained separately for each channel using simulated samples for signal and all background pro- cesses. The set of input variables is chosen by an iterative optimization procedure from a large number of potentially discriminating variables. Among the most discriminating variables for all channels are m(jj),pT(V), DCSV2, the number of additional jets, and the angular separation between the two jets forming the Higgs boson candidate. Events in control regions are used in the ﬁt to normalize the major background processes directly from data. These regions are selected for t t production (TT), and for the production of W and Z bosons in association with either predominantly heavy-ﬂavor
1808.08242v2.pdf|||(HF) or light-ﬂavor (LF) jets using the criteria described in [37]. The signal strength m, deﬁned as the measured production cross section times branching frac- tion divided by the expected SM value, is extracted from a simultaneous binned ﬁt of the signal and control regions. The DNN score is used as the ﬁtted variable in each signal region, while different strategies are used in the control regions. For the TT and LF control regions, only the yields of these processes are considered in the ﬁt. For the HF control region, DCSV2 is used as the ﬁtted variable in the 2-lepton channel, while the score of a dedicated DNN (DNNHF) is used in the 0- and 1-lepton channels. The DNNHF uses the same variables as the signal region DNN, but is trained to individually distinguish the t t, single t, and V+jets background processes. The signiﬁcance of the observed excess of events in the ﬁt is computed using the proﬁle like- lihood asymptotic approximation [81–84]. All results reported here are obtained for a Higgs boson mass of mH=125.09 GeV [26]. For the 2017 data, the observed signiﬁcance is 3.3 s above the background-only hypothesis, while 3.1 sis expected for the SM Higgs boson. The corresponding measured signal strength is m=1.080.34, where the uncertainty is a combi- nation of statistical and systematic components. Table 1 lists the major sources of uncertainty 5 and their observed impact on mfrom the ﬁt. Dominant systematic uncertainties arise from the background normalizations, simulated sample size, b-tagging efﬁciency and misidentiﬁcation rates, and V+jets modeling. All sources of systematic uncertainty are included in the ﬁt as independent nuisance parameters. Table 1: Major sources of uncertainty in the measurement of the signal strength m, and their observed impact ( Dm) from a ﬁt to the 2017 data set, are

Detailed decompositions of the statistical, experimental, and theory components are speciﬁed. The impact of each uncertainty is evaluated considering only that source. Because of correlations in the combined ﬁt between nuisance parameters in different sources, the sum in quadrature for each source does not in general equal the total uncertainty of each component.

To extract this di- boson signal, the DNNs are trained using the simulated samples for this process as signal. All other processes, including VH production (at the predicted SM rate), are treated as background. The only modiﬁcation made to the analysis is the requirement that the signal region is in the in- terval [60, 160 ]GeV in m(jj)for all channels. The excess of events for the combined WZ and ZZ production processes has an observed signiﬁcance of 5.2 sfrom the background-only hypothe- sis, where 5.0 sis expected. The corresponding observed signal strength is m=1.050.22. Measurements of the VH process with H !bb reported above are combined with the re- sults of a similar measurement performed by the CMS Collaboration using data collected at 13 TeV in 2016 corresponding to 35.9 fb 1[37].

The results VH from Run 2 are combined with the results of a similar CMS analysis of the Run 1 data using pp collisions atps=7 and 8 TeV with data samples corresponding to integrated lu- minosities of up to 5.1 and 18.9 fb 1, respectively [25, 44].

A combination of CMS measurements of the H !bb decay is performed, including dedicated analyses for the following production processes: VH (reported above), gluon fusion [38], vec- tor boson fusion [44], and associated production with top quarks [30, 41, 42]. These analyses use data collected at 7, 8 and 13 TeV, depending on the process. In this ﬁt, most sources of 8 systematic uncertainty are treated as uncorrelated. The dominant jet energy scale uncertainties are treated as correlated between processes at the same collision energy, while the theory un- certainties are correlated between all processes and data sets. The observed (expected) signal signiﬁcance is 5.6 (5.5) s, and the measured signal strength is m=1.040.20. In addition to the overall signal strength for the H !bb decay, the signal strengths for the individual pro- duction processes are also determined in this combination, where contributions from a single production process to multiple channels are properly accounted for in the ﬁt.

A combination of all CMS measurements of the VH, H !bb process using proton-proton collisions recorded at center of mass energies of 7, 8, and 13 TeV, yields an observed (expected) signiﬁcance of 4.8 (4.9) standard deviations at mH=125.09 GeV, and the signal strength is m=1.010.22. Combining this result with previous measurements by the CMS Collaboration of the H !bb decay in events where the Higgs boson is produced through gluon fusion, vector boson fusion, or in association with top quarks, the observed (expected) signiﬁcance increases to 5.6 (5.5) standard deviations and the signal strength is m=1.040.20. This constitutes the observation of the H !bb decay by the CMS Collaboration.
